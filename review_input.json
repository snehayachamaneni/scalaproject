Very nice and accommodating. The hostess was great and our server was on top of everything. We really appreciated him informing us that he was going on break and to let the other server know if we needed anything, to just ask. However, we never saw anyone for the last 20 minutes that we were there. They were very busy so we decided not to stay any longer and just walked up to someone at the bar and asked for assistance.\n\nThe food..... what can I say... the chicken satay was amazing and I loved the peanut sauce. I ordered the panang curry and my bf ordered the yellow curry (I think).... we love the flavor, but I was disappointed at the amount of chicken they put (which was barely any at all) in the generous bowl of curry they served it with. It was mainly vegetables and I had to fish for the tiny pieces of chicken hoping there was more at the bottom. I hate to do this, but I have to stress how VERY little meat there was in there :(  A few minutes later our pad Thai arrived. The noodles were completely white and the entire dish basically tasted like noodles with lime juice & veggies. Where's the rest of the sauce?!?!

Reason being, this isn't their first restaurant opening. Globe has two other locations, so it's owners should be able to avoid the rookie mistakes of opening a restaurant. But rather than focus on the facts that it smelled like a construction site, the floors and walls needed some minor finishing work, the staff were wandering about looking slightly confused and a little scared, and the place generally seemed like it probably wasn't ready to open just yet, I'm going to put all that aside and focus on the rest of Globe.\n\nGlobe's focus is on local stuff; that means they try to only serve products that are made close-to-home. Trouble is, I'm not exactly sure how far that close-to-home boundary extends to. I was told that it includes Ontario as a whole, but it could also go much further East or West; their Albacore tuna, for example, comes from BC and their mussels come from PEI. Other items don't explicitly explain where they come from, like the Cornish hen. That's the difficulty with going local though; right-off-the-bat you need to firmly establish your local boundaries. BC and PEI, after all, aren't right around the corner. Why not Maine lobster? Maine is a lot closer and seems a lot more local to me than anywhere in BC.\n\nI suppose my beef here is that if you want to focus on locally produced stuff, then why not do it right down to the last detail? Why have a couple of wines from Italy and the US when you could easily make a wine menu completely from Niagara Peninsula wines or even from West Coast British Columbia (since we haven't yet established where that local line is drawn). I suppose the entire local concept is pretty hot right now, considering the whole farm-to-table trend, but those places are a bit more sincere by growing and sourcing everything onsite. To me, that's what true local eating is all about: setting firm boundaries.\n\nThe main thing that caught me right away-even more so than the local-ness of stuff-was the truly reasonable prices. At my initial walk-in to the beautiful dining room, I expected to pay a bit more, but that wasn't the case at all. Starters are around 11 bucks, entrees are around 22; at prices like that, it's even kind of refreshing, considering how elegant both the dining room and bar spaces are. And the food is good too. The local carnivore flatbread, for example, had a perfectly cooked flatbread base with some delicious, good-quality meats. The baked Spring vegetable tart seemed a little strange served on raw spinach, but the contrast worked nicely together.\n\nThe dining room space is beautiful. 20 foot ceilings, elegant lighting, solid wooden tables. In terms of sheer ambience and sophistication, there's nothing in Bloor West Village that can even come close to competing with Globe.\n\nDespite the wandering servers, we were lucky enough to have the only one that seemed focused. Even though the meddling manager kept needlessly hovering over us mere seconds each time before our server got there, we had fantastic service that pretty much made the entire experience better. If we had another server, I probably would have thought a lot less.\n\nTruth be told, Globe's focus on local products seems to be more of a gimmick at this point rather than a passion. However despite that, it was a pretty good overall experience, opening jitters and stage fright aside. I think that once they work all the kinks out, there'll be nothing in Bloor West Village-an area that is really hurting for some good restaurants to begin with-that can even come close to competing with Globe.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1}

I dug the concept: tapas with a twist. This is definitely not your traditional, Spanish tapas. At Origin, you'll sample small plates with Asian, Italian and Latin influences. I didn't find the menu overwhelming, but our server was more than happy to help steer the meal so that similar and complimentary flavours were eaten together.\n\nIt was tough to narrow it down, as we would have been happy with just about anything on the menu. We started with the tostones: smashed, flattened and deep-fried plantains with guacamole on the side. The plantains were very well seasoned, with generous use of kosher salt and a light dusting of curry powder.\n\nNext up were the deviled eggs with smoked bacon and gremolata and the smoked cod croquettes with saffron aioli. Both were a big hit at the table, disappearing in a flash. I preferred the croquettes of the two, but I didn't exactly NOT eat my share of the deviled eggs either.\n\nThose scrumptious bites devoured, we ordered another bottle of wine (three cheers for Monday night dinners with lots of wine!) and anticipated the arrival of more delectable plates. While we waited, we marveled at the strangeness of the cutlery provided. The only way to balance your knife was blade up. That seemed...dangerous. Especially after the third glass of cabernet sauvignon.\n\nOur next dish appeared and we dove right back in (carefully, so as not to cut ourselves on our upturned knives). A gorgeously-presented order from the Mozzarella Bar: bufala mozzarella with pear, rosemary oil, pine nuts that was drizzled with honey and placed on a crunchy, toasted slice of calabrese bread.\n\nNext up was the Bangkok beef salad with peanuts, mint, mango, fried shallots and a sweet and sour dressing. There was a moment of hesitation while we all tried to dance around the fact that splitting this thing among the three of us might get violent. In the end however, we shared well (our kindergarten teachers would be so proud!). This wasn't an exceptionally complicated dish, but it was done to perfection: the beef was tender and pink; the mangoes were ripe and slippery; the shallots and peanuts added the crunch the dish needed; and the cilantro added the wonderful, bright note at the end. It should be noted that my friend said it was the third time she'd had this particular dish, and it was exactly the same every time. THAT is a sign of a great restaurant.\n\nOur final round of food was to arrive, and we were practically giddy with excitement. We had decided on the Chinois duck with pickled cucumber, hoisin and sriracha sauce on a chive pancake, the curried shrimp with naan and the miso-glazed black cod with soba noodles and a ginger vinaigrette. We knew each dish would be good, but didn't know HOW good. We had spent the first half of the meal happily eating away and we were by no means disappointed with our choices. But these last three dishes absolutely blew them all out of the water. The duck was crispy and, I must say, substantial. The kitchen does not scrimp on the portions at all with this dish! The sweet hoisin sauce was a great compliment to the duck and the heat of the sriracha. A definite must-order at Origin.\n\nNext up, we attacked the curried shrimp, which was intensely flavoured and perfectly spicy. The soft, aromatic naan bread sopped up the spicy broth that was left after devouring the plump, juicy shrimp. Another dish that hit its mark!\n\nFinally (and kind of sadly), we came to our last dish: the black cod. Black cod is one my favourite fish and I have it a fair bit. When I was out in Vancouver earlier this year, I had it almost once a day. but this black cod might be the best I've had...ever. It was flaky, tender and moist. The miso glaze was pleasantly salty and the skin, most importantly, was nice and crispy. The soba noodles were served with the ginger vinaigrette and by the time we were done, there was literally nothing left on the plate. In all likelihood, the best dish of the night though the three of us never could decide on a clear winner in that category.\n\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend Origin to anyone who has some reasonably adventurous taste buds and who is willing to share. There is one composed plate that makes a meal - a burger combo with Spanish fries and a float. I have no doubt it's delicious, but it seems kind of beside the point of a restaurant like this. Go with friends, go on a date, go with family. It's not a cheap night out, but it is most definitely money well spent.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Or, in this case, a bar by its' signage. Let's face it, I'm a sucker for good signage. And Souz Dal has it. The rusty globe hangs outside like a relic, the name of the bar cut into the side. Lit, and glowingfrom within, it reminds me of one of those tin punch-out crafts made from a (insert random legume) canat summer camp. But much cooler of course. It was this sign that caught my attention on more than one occasion, beckoning me in when I had somewhere else to be. Finally, one night a couple of weeks ago, I gave in to its sirens call. I was a little bit disappointed.\n\nIt was devoid of people save for us and the lonely bartender. I say lonely, butjudging by his charm (see: none) he probably liked it better thatway. Granted though, it was early - Souz Dal only has a drink menu - and a few more folk trickled in as the night wore on.\n\nThe stars I gave are attributed solelyto the bar's ambience. Dimly lit, and painted in muted reds and oranges it has an earthy orMoorish feel to it. Worn textiles and cathedral mirrors adorn the walls, while candles flicker on every table, casting shadows. The back patio has a similar vibe happening, cloistered in by high walls, andlit by candles wedged in the mouths of old wine bottles.\n\nNow I rarely turn down a good patio, but in this case I chose aseat inside, which says a lot.Reclined on velvet benches at our table by the open front window, we watched College Street come alive as we perused the drink menu. I was in a cocktail mood, and my friend had read somewhere that Souz Dal claimed to have the \"best\" mojitos in the city, so that was the first order I placed. \n\nNow I've been to Cuba. I did a little backpacking, starting in Havanaand makingmy way to the South coast. I wouldn't say I'm a connoiseur of the mojito because of this, but I diddrink my fair share, and like to think I know a thing or two about a good one. And this wasn't one of them. There wasn't nearly enough mint or sugar, so it was overwhelmingly bitter. I don't like my mojitos to taste like Kool-Aid, but I do like a little sweetness to curb the edge. \n\nUnlikely to order another of the same, but unwilling to give up on the bar, we tried a few other beverages. Nothing wowed us. The Moscow Mule with its ginger beer offered a nice slow burn, but it also wasn't a repeat offender. The fortune cookie garnish on the lychee-infused Soho martini was fun, but not nearly as tasty as a lychee would have been. \n\nAlthough funky signage and ambience mean a lot to me, a good drink means even more, so chancesare Iwon't be returning to Souz Dal. If however, you are in the market for an intimate date setting (see: empty bar) then head on over. And if a mediocre mojito is your thing, then you can get them herefor $5.75 on Mondays.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

On a relatively quiet stretch of Bloor West, between Dovercourt and Dufferin, sits Mazz Sushi.\n\nAn unassuming neighbourhood favourite for years, Mazz Sushi has been one of the few sushi options for Bloorcourt and Bloordale residents. Each time I visit, I am amazed by how bustling a place it is with the constant turning of tables and the rapid fire filling of take-out bags.\n\nOn a recent weeknight excursion, the small dining room was full, with a great mix of students, parents with young children and older couples; a typical audience for Mazz. Soon the servers were trying to accommodate extra guests and pointing out that it would be a '10 to 15 minute wait' for a table.\n\nSeated, with menus in hand, the server soon appeared with the tea that was barely just ordered. Mazz's tea is very earthy in flavour with a hint of barley. Moving on quickly to another table, he left us to continue to ponder the menus, not returning for quite some time.\n\nUpon his return, we quickly placed our order for various maki and sashimi hoping that the busyness of the place wouldn't slow the normally lightning-quick service.\n\nAfter a moment, he returned with a bowl of congee and an amuse-bouche of marinated tofu. Don't be alarmed, these are Mazz's welcome dishes. I find the tofu pleasant enough, but the congee seems a little too heavy and porridge-like to start a meal.\n\nBefore these two were done, he was back again with the ubiquitous Miso soup and house salad. The soup was seasoned and flavourful with lots of nori and tofu. The salad was a small mixture of iceberg lettuce with some vegetable shavings and slices: by the book, but not out of this world.\n\nJust as we were finishing our appetizers, the first of our rolls arrived. We ordered a Spicy Tuna maki: tuna mixed with crumbled tempura and hot sauce. My guest, not a fan of spicy food, likes Mazz's version, as she doesn't normally find it too spicy. Unfortunately this time they were a little too spicy for her. Good for me, but bad for her. A minor thing, but consistency means repeat business.\n\nNext, the rest of our food arrived: a sashimi dinner and Dynamite roll. The sashimi dinner is always a joy at Mazz, and this time was no different. The plate usually contains a nice selection of tuna, white tuna, salmon and possibly mackerel, and always has more pieces then advertised. This time was no different, and the fish was very fresh. The only complaint, and I've found this happens quite regularly in Toronto, is that the white tuna was served too cold. The Dynamite roll was large, but a little tasteless; seemingly prepared in too much of a hurry, a couple of pieces unraveled and fell apart on the plate.\n\nOverall, Mazz Sushi let us down a little on this visit. The staff seemed rushed and unable to provide the consistency that we have come to expect. Not once during our meal were we offered more tea, a slight unheard-of in a sushi restaurant. The food, although served quickly, wasn't up to their usual standards, and the wait to order was long. And although it remains quite inexpensive, the discount on the receipt for paying with cash seems to have disappeared with the updating of cash register system.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Sure, I know the breakfast is only 3 dollars, so I probably shouldn't be hard on it; but regardless of price, I'd still like my meal to be served hot and be put together with some level of care and attention.\n\nThis is a pretty mediocre breakfast here: a slice of warm ham, a strip of old bacon, browned toast, over\/undercooked eggs, leftover potatoes, breakfast served here is less-than-spectacular, and the service staff doesn't seem to care if you complain about it; I'm sure they've heard it all countless times before.\n\nAll of this, of course, is served in one Toronto's prized possessions, High Park. If it wasn't for the location, I certainly would have given them 1 star. In fact, it wasn't for the location, I probably wouldn't have eaten there at all.

Uncle Betty's has only been open for a few months, but it already seems to have garnered a dedicated following. We went to Uncle Betty's on a bustling Friday night, looking for a casual meal and easy going atmosphere; Uncle Betty's certainly provided both. Painted in bright blue and cheery orange, lots of seating inside, and a small patio off the front, we felt right at home. Several families were enjoying meals with their kids in tow As the evening wore on though, most of those families were replaced with twenty and thirty-somethings looking for a cool place to hang out.\n\nOffering sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, salads, and many other of Uncle Betty's specialty creations, the menu is fairly extensive and varied. We ordered the roasted vegetable sandwich with a salad, and the grilled cheese sandwich, which was made with homemade mac-and-cheese and meatloaf stuffed inside. Their grilled cheese also comes in a pulled pork variety, which I am sure we will try on our next outing. Both meals were great, the vegetable sandwich was warm, the cheese was nicely melted, and the bread was crisp. The grilled cheeses sandwich was deemed as one of the \"best ever,\" however, the portion size was on the small side for a $15 sandwich. Both of us agreed that the sandwich could be a little bigger, but overall we were impressed with the quality and creative effort put into the food. \n\nFor dessert, we each tried a Dreesen's cinnamon sugar doughnut, made fresh on site, and although they were pretty tasty, I am setting my sights on the ice cream bar next time. It is far too bright and colourful to miss, with jars of candy toppings and a great selection of ice cream flavours to choose from.\n\nThe service was friendly and attentive, and we had a conversation with the owner, Samara Melanson, as we were leaving. Samara and her husband recently opened the restaurant, and it's always great to meet the owner while dining out and learn about the creation of the restaurant and where some of the ideas for the food come from. She told us that chef Paul Lampa was brought over from Coquine restaurant, which explains the \"gourmet\" comfort food bent and the locally sourced ingredients. \n\nMost appetizers are priced from 6 - 10 dollars; entrees varied in price from about 9 - 15 dollars, and wine and beer was in the 6 - 8 range. And Uncle Betty's carries Kicking Horse coffee, which is an instant sell and a welcome find for this Toronto-transplanted Western girl. \n\nBetty's also offers what looks to be a delicious weekend brunch, with homestyle blueberry pancake and Uncle Betty's own take on eggs benny, which comes served on a doughnut.  We will definitely be back to Uncle Betty's to try some of the other great entrees on the menu, and  of course to dig into their ice cream bar.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":2}

A friend used to live there many moons ago, but we spent most of our time drinking red wine on her porch until the wee hours in the morning instead of exploring what the neighbourhood had to offer. In recent years, however, the lure of the restaurants lining Roncesvalles Ave has drawn me to the West side of the city more frequently. I never know quite what to expect when I arrive, but I am always pleasantly surprised.\n\nOne such surprise awaited me at The Ace. I had heard that the space had been standing empty for ages; even that it had once been a Chinese restaurant. Now headed up by chef Peter McKnight, it has been reopened as a place to stop in for some classic comfort food: fried chicken, burgers, soup, Shepherd's pie. While the menu has changed, the décor most certainly did not; the new owners have kept as much of the original decoration as possible giving the place an authentic 1950's feel.\nMy friend and I settled in for our meal in a booth near the back of across from the open kitchen. When asked what we'd like to drink, I tried to sneak a peek at the taps available only to find that there were none in sight. Well, no taps that I recognized anyway. Our waiter informed us that the fantastic milkshake mixer sitting on the counter served as the taps.  A great aesthetic touch behind the bar.\n\nWe submitted our drink orders - Mill St. for me, the Ace Manhattan for my friend - and took stock of the menu.  Written out on paper were five or six appetizers and five or six mains from which to choose. We pondered several options, but when the waiter announced that one of the specials of the day was a \"Christmas burger\" the whole plan changed. Ground turkey with stuffing in the middle, topped with cranberry chutney? THIS had to be eaten. As delicious as it sounded, it was actually better than anticipated.  It hit all the parts of your palate and it was gobbled up in minutes. \n\nAlso sampled were the deep-fried Brussels sprouts with dill aioli and the gorgeous, briny oysters. Both were truly excellent and personified what The Ace is all about: simple food done perfectly. My dining companion and I nearly stabbed each other with our forks trying to get at the Brussels sprouts, something I truly thought would never, ever happen in my lifetime. \n\nIf you're at The Ace, do not miss the fried chicken, which is succulent, juicy and crispy, served with him gravy, collard greens and cornbread (though why the cornbread is served on the gravy is a bit beyond me, as it has the unfortunate effect of making the bread a big soggy after a while). The fresh pasta with tuna, chiles, plum tomatoes and basil was cooked to exactly al dente and the flaked trout with potatoes, radishes and red onions struck a great balance of temperature, texture and flavor. \nNo matter how full you may be from the well-sized  portions, I implore you not to skip dessert. The ice cream in particular is outstanding. Do not miss the oatmeal, stout or chocolate-rosemary concoctions: they are all made in-house and I am not ashamed to admit that I asked for an entire vat of the chocolate-rosemary ice cream to take home so that I could swim in it. Seriously. Do not miss dessert!\n\nBy the time we left around 8pm, The Ace had a line up of hungry patrons eager to relax in a comfortable, homey environment with excellent comfort food, attentive staff and a great bartender. I would suggest dressing in layers as it gets quite warm, as evidenced by the perpetually fogged-over front window.  Go early or go late or go for brunch. You won't be disappointed.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Not anymore...\n\nA former Burger King at Bathurst and Bloor has become the second Toronto location for the Vancouver dynamo chain. It's easy enough to almost walk past Guu Sakabar--nicknamed Guu 2--as you travel down Bloor Street; the exterior is dark and the signage is minimal, as are the windows. Once you do see it though, the slate-coloured walls and wood accents look stunning and attractive.\n\nInside, things are kept just as simple and uncluttered with a very open concept dining room filled with long wooden tables. Unlike the Church Street location, this Guu has a small separate dining space where patrons are expected to de-shoe before being seated on the floor. Actually, you won't find a typical table anywhere at Guu Sakabar. In the main dining room, the idea is that you share your experience with others at large communal tables--with your friends, or with strangers. If you're uncomfortable with these seating arrangements you can sit at the bar, but fair warning you will be right in the thick of things...\n\nThis restaurant is famous for a quirky element that is unavoidable during your dining experience; from the time you enter to the time you leave you'll be subject to loud yells and cheers from the staff that boom through the whole restaurant. They boisterously welcome you when you enter, and give you a loud farewell when you leave. I would assume there are a handful of people out there who would be infinitely turned off by this, but I think it gives this place one of the best atmospheres around. I almost expected the Happy Birthday chant to be low-key as an ironic contrast, but they don't miss a beat. The entire staff literally sings a birthday song to you, even the chefs behind the counter.\n\nWith that in mind, this has to be one of the most well-trained service and kitchen staff I've ever come across. I went to Guu 2 on a Tuesday evening, and it was jam-packed. Between seating guests, taking orders, delivering orders, cooking, clearing and processing payments, I have no idea how they manage to keep on top of their enthusiastic cheers. Guu has raised the bar for what I believe a well-working service staff is capable of. I will say that a couple of our orders that I consider starters, like salads and sashimi, came out last, but the dishes are small, and if you order a few and they come out of the kitchen so fast that the sequence hardly matters. The organization and teamwork is impeccable; we sat at the bar in front of all the action and more than once, a dish would be ready to go out and the chefs would hand them right to us. It seems like everyone knows where everything goes and what everyone is doing. Awesome.\n\nWell to me, a restaurant is worth nothing if the food doesn't hold up, so I am happy to say that the food on this Japanese Tapas-style menu does have a strong voice, even in this noisy dining room.\n\nA variety of dishes are offered, from the expected edamame and sashimi to the more unique items like puffed octopus (a soufflé of tender octopus and creamy cheese) and fried skewers of quail egg. Each item's price point is around what I expect from a Tapas restaurant, but the servings are very substantial. The sashimi salad ($7.80) in particular is large enough to be split amongst two people heartily, or four people with ease. The sashimi pieces are definitely worthy of two bites each and you can get six in a platter for only $6.80.\n\nOne benefit to sitting at the bar is watching each dish go out. One by one we found ourselves ogling at what was going past.\n\nQuite simply, the food is great, and you certainly get more than what you pay for. It was just a fun dining experience to be a part of; and I did feel as though we were part of it. You may have to yell your conversations across the table to be heard, but at the same time, you'll be smiling while doing it.","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":3}

Every couple of years some new ingredient or dish seems to capture the attention of cooks everywhere. Someone does it well, and then soon niche restaurants seem to be popping up everywhere.\n\nA number of years ago, it was the burrito, soon the poutine became chic.\nLately it seems like everyone needs to prove they have the best Southern-style barbeque.\n\nOn a recent Saturday night, I had the opportunity to eat at Lou Dawg's; Southern Sandwiches at King and Portland in the Entertainment District. Nestled in the basement, Lou Dawg's seems to be punching above its weight. It has a fairly small front of house, and on this night, a third of that front of house seemed to be taken up by an impromptu stage while the sound and light guys were setting up. And once they did, it was loud! Not only that, it wasn't even music. The sound system was blaring an audio feed from the football game projected on the large screen on the opposite wall. Despite that, the place was buzzing. Pretty much all the tables were full and the young-ish crowd that was there seemed to be happy enough, with tables full of plates and pints.\n\nWith our large order placed at the bar, we watched a group clear out and quickly snagged the table. No sooner did he drop off our pints did our food arrive. It was super quick, and it couldn't have been more than five minutes. My guests and I ordered the gamut of the menu: pulled chicken, beef brisket, and pulled pork sandwiches with potato salad, coleslaw and a 'Loutine' (poutine with pulled pork). Everything looked great...\n\nThe pulled pork had a pleasant smoky flavour and was quite juicy and moist, but after a couple of bites it seemed to be very one note; there wasn't that nice tang you get with true southern barbeque. The pulled chicken was very dry. This is a dish most people have difficulty doing well, and I don't think Lou Dawg's is any different. It seemed like it had been sitting around for awhile... waiting for someone to order it... The beef brisket was popping with flavour. It was succulent, with just the right amount of fattiness. If you're there, I highly recommend it.\n\nSide dishes is where Lou Dawg's really shines. Their coleslaw is creamy, sweet and crisp, with dried cranberries and raisins. And the potato salad? Truly made with love. It burst with flavours of dill and mustard seed, and the potatoes were cooked to the perfect texture.\n\nThe small poutine was quite a large portion. The fries were as they should be: crisp and fresh tasting with a hefty salting. If the cheese was curds, you couldn't tell. They had lost all of their consistency from over heating. The chicken gravy was way too salty and overpowered the mild flavour on the pulled pork.\n\nOverall, Lou Dawg's didn't live up to the hype. I've had better Southern barbeque at places that don't specialize in it, and way better at places that do. Coupled with that, the restaurant seemed a little unsure of itself. Is it trying to be a restaurant? a sports bar? or a neighbourhood performance space? or just a hangout for friends of the staff? This indecision usually sounds the death knell of any place. So while the sides and brisket made it a place worth returning to, there wasn't much keeping me from going somewhere else.","useful":8,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Well, it was until The Mugshot Tavern opened anyways... The Mugshot easily provides the perfect answer to filling that void, and then some. Truly nice owners, delicious food, and a killer environment, this place takes the neighbourhood bar way beyond what it's expected to be.\n\nIf the Mugshot doesn't have the best draft selection in a 10 km radius, it certainly has the most well-thought-out one. These guys obviously love beer, and more obviously is that they've put a ton of thought into what is being pulled from the taps. It's all craft beer, and some interesting stuff at that. Chances are they have a few you've never even heard of, like the King Pilsner and Warthog Ale. It wouldn't be a stretch to say that they're probably one of only a handful of places in the city with either on tap. Don't expect to find Canadian or Blue here; what they offer is much more creative than any of that stuff.\n\nThe food, and the entire menu for that matter, is equally well-thought out. It's a killer mix of Southern-soul and comfort food, and they do a dam fine job of pulling it off. You can expect to find Southern favorites, like fried chicken with fritters, and some not so expected ones, like in-house-made corn dogs with chutney. The presentation is pretty decent too and again, goes beyond the typical bar stuff. It's pretty obvious that the people manning the kitchen know what the hell they're doing back there. Rarely do I go to a restaurant and have difficulty deciding what to order; at The Mugshot I was torn between a few items.\n\nThey've done a dam good job of ridding the place of all remnants of the defunct McKenzies that used to take up the place. They've clearly spent a lot of time, thought, and energy turning it into something completely new. The environment, painted in bright red and tactfully covered in old-school, famous mugshot photos, is easily the kind of space you could hang out for a long, long time. It's comfortable and welcoming, the way a neighbourhood local should be. Despite not being an overly large place, it still accommodates nicely, and any excess people can spill onto their cozy rooftop patio.\n\nAnd the staff at Mugshot? They couldn't be any friendlier. Having only been open about a week or so, you'd never know it by their attitudes. Likely working long hours, round-the-clock, getting the place ready and established, they're still sociable, out-going, and friendly. I sure-as-hell didn't feel like a stranger in this joint, and I don't think anyone with even the teeniest bit of personality would either. Even coming in by yourself is sure to get you some conversation.\n\nIt's clear that, after just opening, they're still trying to establish their crowd. It's still sorta random as to the people that might be in there. While one day the bar could be full of seniors, that evening it could be packed with a younger crowd. It seems to be dependent on the time of day, but it's also, unfortunately, the way the neighbourhood seems to work. Customers are sorta like family; you can't really pick 'em.\n\nThe Mugshot isn't just the kind of place you sit, drink, and hide from the world, although it provides that pretty well; it's also the kind of place that you can unexpectedly get some truly imaginative and delicious food in a comfortable and welcoming space. In a neighbourhood like High Park, The Mugshot Tavern is unrivaled in every respect.","useful":16,"funny":1,"cool":9}

Five of us arrived for dinner last week and were greeted the charming co-owner, Tom, who presided over the evening with grace and warmth.\n\nWe spent an inordinately long time trying to decide from the 10 appetizers and 10 mains. Each looked better than the next and made our decisions more difficult than usual. While we deliberated, a bottle of shiraz and a custom champagne drink were ordered and a basket of some of the best foccaccia I've had in a long time arrived at the table. The crust was crispy and salty and the filled basket did not last long.\n\nAfter a solid twenty minutes of deliberation, we placed our orders: the romaine heart salad to split two ways; steamed PEI mussels in a grainy mustard butter with a side order of fries; roasted Chicken Supreme stuffed with pulled pork (yes, you read that right) served with bacon & smoked cheddar Israeli couscous; the house burger, made with ground chuck, veal and braised short rib; pan-seared arctic char served atop Israeli couscous with lobster; and roasted halibut topped with salsa verde and served with potatoes and mussels.\n\nWhen the food arrived, five sets of eyes widened. The plates were beautiful and smelled fantastic.  I'm lucky enough to have friends who share, so I got a little of everyone's meal. While all were delicious, there were a few outstanding bites that I would return for which I would The Westerly in a heartbeat. The Israeli couscous with smoked cheddar and bacon was aromatic and, surprisingly, not heavy at all. The smoked ingredients permeated the little couscous pearls, infusing them with a ton of flavour.  Next was the burger which was so tender it nearly fell apart in my hands as I ate it, juice running down my hands. It came with a spicy salsa that cut through the richness of the burger beautifully.  Undoubtedly, this is a big crowd pleaser.\n\nBetween the two fish dishes, I preferred the halibut. I liked the lightness of the fish paired with the bright salsa verde. There was certainly nothing wrong with the char - it was rich, not overcooked and the lobster-laden Israeli couscous was excellent. The balance and combination of ingredients in the halibut dish, though, really appealed to me and I will likely order it upon my next visit.\n\nAmazingly, we had some room left for shared desserts. I opted to split the warm apple crumble with fresh whipped cream while others went for the lemon tart. The crumble was comforting, filled with cinnamon and topped with large, buttery pieces of crumble. Incredible. Definitely a great end to a meal but I recommend sharing as it is quite heavy - otherwise you may be rolling out of the restaurant, pants unzipped.\n\nI would return to The Westerly, unquestionably. My friends and I had a great time in a charming restaurant in which we were treated well (though there was some miscommunication with a dessert, it was rectified gracefully).  If you haven't been, add it to your list and prepare for a lovely brunch or dinner!","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0}

I have visited it on several occasions, and each time I leave, I debate whether sharing this place with the world is worth having to wait for a table during an already busy dinner rush. My conscience prevails, as 5 Doors North is too great of a restaurant not to review, and share with my fellow TOFoodReviews readers.\n\nA spur of the moment, \"Thursday night out\" decision, led Andy and I to 5 Doors North, knowing we would get a great meal. We were seated in the front area of the dining room, perfect for people watching along the Eglinton-Davisville and Yonge street corridor. The furnishings are worn, kitschy, and mismatched, but only add to the warmth and charm of the restaurant.  The restaurant menu is hand-written and photocopied, followed by an evolving list of specials on the chalkboard, which are carefully selected, and always guaranteed to be great.\n\nThe wine list is small and filled with some robust reds. I ordered the Pinot Noir, which I have to say, just didn't do it for me, it was a bit thin and wasn't quite what I was hoping for. Andy's Malbec was fabulous, so we both ordered another glass for the second round. Wines by the glass are anywhere from $7 to $11, and bottles in the $30-$50 range. Overall, wines are priced fairly well, but I would love to see a little more variety to match the diverse food menu.\n\nThe appetizer list is long, and everything sounds incredible. They have smoked salmon, Prosciutto, mussels, a delicious polenta dish, on top of the list of daily specials, which included cauliflower soup, avocado bruschetta, and crab cakes. We went with the soup, beef Carpaccio with Pecorino cheese & roasted onion, and the beet salad. First out was the roasted beet salad with scallion aioli & lotus chips, which was wonderful, the goat cheese soft and warm, and the beets sweet and crunchy. The roasted cauliflower soup was smoky and creamy, but not too heavy; a perfect start to the meal, and the beef Carpaccio was some of the best, the cheese and onion offsetting the beef perfectly.\n\nFor our mains, I ordered the gnocchi Gorgonzola special and Andy the braised brisket ravioli. The meals were incredible. The gnocchi was awesome, fresh and soft, but the real winner was the Gorgonzola cream sauce. So creamy, it certainly blew my cheese calorie allotment for the week, but so worth it. Garnished with scallions and fresh pepper, the meal needed nothing more to bring out the strong flavours in the Gorgonzola.\n\nThe braised brisket ravioli was probably one of the more interesting meals we have ever had. I was unsure what to expect, but the beef was perfect, melt-in-your-mouth, wrapped in fresh pasta, with beef au jus and cream to make up the ravioli sauce. It would be worth phoning in advance to see if this was on the specials menu, as this dish just has to be tried.\n\nThe prices are right, entrées run from $14-$20, with appetizers in the $8-$12 range. The service is extremely friendly, with everyone pitching in to seat, serve and check-in. It's a family run restaurant, and you can tell by the attitudes and the recommendations of the staff that they all love the food at 5 Doors North as much as you will.","useful":7,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Bamburger is appealingly decorated in dark brown, natural wood and lots of greenery complimenting the patio and the booths. The lighting is soft and the seating is cozy. This is the kind of place that you could hang out for a great meal without the rushed \"diner\" feeling that often comes with burger joints. Our server was friendly, talkative and more than willing to explain the options on the menu, as there are many, and recommend some personal favourites.\n\nStarting off with drinks, Bamburger serves beer, wine, and old-fashioned Stewart's soda, but what is a burger joint without milkshakes? Bamburger specializes in milkshakes, including the usual vanilla and chocolate suspects, as well a special flavour each day for the nice price of $3.95.\n\nThe menu is varied, offering up soup, salads, sandwiches and desserts, as well as a kid's menu, but almost everyone here is in it for the burgers. Bamburger allows you to choose almost every aspect of your burger, from the type of bun, burger patty (beef, chicken, turkey, pork or veggie), as well as a plethora of toppings, some for the asking- tzatziki, chipotle mayo, olives, horseradish, pickles and banana peppers, and some for a price, $1-$1.50 each- bacon, avocado, onion rings, mushrooms, pineapple, and every kind of cheese you could imagine. Included in these cheesy wonders is \"Bamburger's Signature Cheddar Cheese Sauce ($1.50),\" and it is worth every penny. You can order the cheese sauce on your burger, or as a side for dipping your fries, and I would highly recommend both. Just try not to think of how much butter and cheese have gone into that little bowl, and instead, focus on how delicious it is!\n\nWe went with the \"Bambamburger ($11.50),\" which is 2\/3 of a pound of prime ground chuck, and the chicken burger ($9.95) for myself, on whole-wheat buns. Both of us outfitted our burgers with toppings galore, including mushrooms, onions, garlic mayo and cheese sauce for the \"Bambamburger,\" and avocado, chipotle mayo, dill pickles and jalapeno peppers for the chicken burger. Our meals took a while to arrive, as everything is cooked from scratch, but when they did, we received two overflowing burgers, with awesome homemade French fries and onion rings to match. Lesson learned from this particular trip to Bamburger is just because all of these delectable toppings are available, it doesn't mean you should put all of them on your burger. We both lost our buns to the slippery extras, and ended up eating our burgers by topping, not as one cohesive piece.  Next visit I will try a couple toppings at a time, and see if I fare any better.\n\nBamburger serves up great burgers, fries and shakes at a fairly good price, although if you go a little overboard with the toppings, you might quickly end up with a $20 burger, without realizing it. The service was friendly and engaging, and the atmosphere was very comfortable and neighbourly.\n\nIf you are hunting for a real deal on a burger, Bamburger might not be what you are looking for, but if you are more on the adventurous side, and want to have fun creating your own burger masterpiece, Bamburger will deliver.","useful":8,"funny":0,"cool":3}

That might actually be giving it more credit than it deserves though, because I've been to some cafeterias that aren't absolutely horrible.\n\nI remember stopping in there in the past and having some pretty decent souvlaki, but what you're presented with now is nothing close to decent. The souvlaki is tough and tasteless, the rice is lukewarm and overcooked, the vegetables were likely previously frozen; bottom line is, this is in no way an accurate representation of what Greek food is in Toronto. Add in the sweaty, pushy serving staff, and you have an all around poor dining experience.\n\nI actually complained via email last time I went, and I promptly received an email back from the owner full of profuse apologies and promises of a better meal, nicer service and an overall better experience if I returned. Although I appreciated his effort, the last thing I want is to be forced another meal there. I know restaurants can have a bad day, and I'm willing to overlook that. But from what I saw, this was just another day in the life of crappy restaurant living of it's achievements in the distant past.\n\nOn a street with as many options as the Danforth, there's absolutley no reason (or excuse!) to end up in this joint.","useful":5,"funny":2,"cool":1}

Upon arrival we found that this is an odd spot on Queen West where a string of three of four Indian restaurants are all lined up side-by-side, so which to choose?\n\nOne thing I love about Toronto restaurants that you won't always find in smaller cities are menus posted on the outside of the building.  Little India stood out for it's well-organized, easy to understand and well-priced menu - in we went.\n\nIt is definitely an intimate spot, having no real capacity to hold very large groups, but was still quite comfortable for our dining duo. It was a cold Thursday night and not overly busy, so it did not feel crowded, and it gave the servers that much more time to be attentive.\n\nThe menu is substantial and has a variety of dishes. The price range is about $15 - $20 for an entrée, but be sure to ask which ones come with rice or Naan and which don't so that you can order them on the side.  First up was the mixed platter appetizer, which included samosas, onion bhajia, pakora and spring rolls. Everything was crispy, hot and just the right size for something before the entrée-and it came in at under $5.\n\nFor the main, I ordered the chicken kebab and my dinner partner had the Madras chicken.  Fair warning: if they tell you it's going to be hot, then it's truly hot.  We are all too accustomed to those Canadian-ized restaurants that tone down their spiciness to appease the masses, and it is arguable that Little India may do this too, but in any case, take the servers' recommendations to heart.  I do enjoy some heat, but my taste buds can't handle extremes, so I steered clear on this occasion-except for a little taste of the Madras.  For those of you who do like spice, you'll love this!  It has that heat that creeps up after a few bites, not that punch-in-the-face-burn that you might get from cheap chicken wings covered in Frank's Red Hot. Our server did lean my friend toward the less-spicy of the dishes she was deciding between at first, much to her dismay, but as it turns out his suggestion right on.  As for my tamer dish, it had more of a Mediterranean flavour to it; grilled, lemony and came with a cucumber salad garnished with cilantro.  It was a happy reminder of summer while dining in the depths of winter.\n\nOne of the greatest things about this restaurant is something I was not even able to take advantage of: the lunch buffet.  This is a bit of a hike from my own home and workplace, but for those of you in the area, I say go for it!  Buffets have a bit of a bad reputation (and for the most part it's well-deserved), but a small arrangement at a non-chain location like this can be a perfect opportunity to try a variety of what is on the menu, especially if it is food you're mostly unfamiliar with.\n\nOverall, I can't leave you saying it was the very best Indian cuisine I've ever had, but I can say that I wasn't disappointed, and I would go back again-especially for that buffet.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":2}

At least that's what the button said that was given to me by the man behind the counter at Pancho's Bakery.  After noticing the small collection I have attached to both my bag and jacket, he was quick to give me a new addition.  I was hesitant to let it join the ranks, after all \"I heart\" anything is a pretty bold statement, and to be honest, as of that moment, I had never had a mind blowing churro experience, or at least one that would have me declaring such strong feelings for them.  The only time I ever ate a churro was at an establishment once promoted by a talking Chihuahua, so you can understand my hesitation.  I pocketed the button, as its fate would be determined later.\n\nPancho's Bakery makes up a portion of what is titled the Latin American Food Court in Kensington Market.  The tiny little storefront on Augusta Avenue is deceiving, as it houses more businesses than I would have guessed.  Assuming it was only Pancho's in the building, I was surprised (and excited) to see a stall selling tacos, another dealing in empanadas, and the infamous pop-up Agave y Aguacate.  Pancho's itself occupies the space right up front, across from the Korean dumpling stand... I'm not sure exactly how they fit in.  Apparently the Latin American Food Court doesn't discriminate, and why should they?  Dumplings are tasty, and well, I'm sure another vendor only helps pay the rent.\n\nIt was around twelve o'clock on a Friday when my friend and I decided to check out Pancho's. Neither of us had eaten, but we couldn't quite justify having churros for lunch. We are of the mindset however, that believes dinner shouldn't be the only meal followed by dessert, so our afternoon repast that day would have a churro chaser.\n\nFull of carnitas tacos, and kimchi empanadas (Korean dumpling cart influence!), but not too full to pass up deep-fried dough, we made our way back to Pancho's.  I was promptly questioned as to the whereabouts of my button but I quickly placed my order as a distraction.\n\nThe churros at Pancho's are piped out in the front window, and brought to life for all too see, before quickly being led to their delicious demise in the deep fryer.  They are served hot, either plain or filled with your choice of chocolate, dulce de leche or strawberry syrup.  We ordered four, one of each flavour, and a plain.  At my servers recommendation I also grabbed some bread pudding and traditional Mexican concha bread.  As we had lost our seats (there aren't many to begin with) and the sun was shining, we took our treats to go.\n\nWe started with the chocolate, moved on to the dulce de leche, followed by the strawberry, and thus ended anticlimactically with the plain. They were crispy and sugar coated on the outside, while soft and (with the exception of the plain) accompanied with a burst of sweetness from within. Churro rookies be warned... a churro is a like a deep fried dough straw.  Any filling that goes in the top, will ultimately come out the bottom.  We left a sticky trail through the streets of Kensington that led back to Pancho's.  If Hansel and Gretel only knew about these, they would have rethought the breadcrumb idea.\n\nLater at home, I popped the bread pudding and concha into the oven.  Concha is a sweet bread that resembles a clam shell, hence the name.  It tasted a little of brown sugar, but overall it was bland.  I think the idea however is to serve it alongside a cup of café con leche or hot chocolate and get to dunking.  I could see this working in its favour.\n\nThe bread pudding however (traditionally served around this time of year to be eaten for Lent) was delicious.  Dense, but very moist, and just sweet enough, my girlfriend went nuts over it. Apparently she doesn't have a problem with dessert after other meals either - and this time it was breakfast.\n\nNow I'm not a fan of donuts, and the churro is essentially the donuts Spanish cousin, but I would take a Pancho's churro over a donut any day, and these are what I will return for.  As it turns out, I really do \"heart\" churros after all.  Now where did I put that button?","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":1}

It's a good spot if you are looking to throw a large-group party or corporate event dinner. They definitely have room to accommodate large groups for dinner and drinks.\n\nThe menu is set up with shareable appetizers as well as traditional entrees. We tried a variety of starters, all which ranged from $13.50 to $16.50.\n\nFirst, we tried the Louisiana Shrimp Po Boys. This sharable serving came with three Po boy sliders, along with a helping of fries. The shrimp were lightly spiced instead of battered like a traditional po'boy sandwich, and were served with creole tartar sauce, lettuce and tomatoes. The buns were a bit oversized for the shrimp in the sandwiches. Something tells me they are better suited for the hamburger sliders also on the menu.\n\nNext up for appetizers is the Charcuterie Flatbread. This was a great value! The flatbread that came to our table was the size of a small pizza. Each of us had a few pieces, which is a great size for an appetizer. As a big fan of a traditional charcuterie board I was interested in trying this out, and was pleasantly surprised. The meat was not overpowered by the cheese, tomato and sauce base on the flatbread. Would highly recommend this one!\n\nTraditional entrees were next... I tried the Surf n Turf, a new menu item, which was $29. I really liked the unique presentation, which each item set up on a long board instead of a traditional steak and potatoes plate. The steak was cooked exactly as I requested. The lobster tail was a generous size, and the lemon-garlic butter sauce wasn't overpowering at all. It was cooked perfectly too and was very meaty.\n\nUnfortunately, the double cheese baked potato was very dry. It seems like they are premade and had cheese, asparagus, and shallots added and reheated. A simply baked potato would have been a better choice for this one. The attempt at an added flair didn't add much to this dish.\n\nUnder recommendation from our waitress, we also tried the Penne Jambalaya. This huge helping of pasta came with big chunks of chorizo, chicken breast and shrimp, in a Sambucca Cajun cream sauce. The sauce tasted a lot like vodka sauce, for those who have never tried Sambucca before. The portion size was impressive, and the pasta had a good kick of spice to it too. Definitely a win, and at $19 it was well worth it.\n\nOnce 10pm hit, the music was turned up to a deafening level, and other tables of guests began to arrive, including a few party groups with bottle service for the night. We decided it was time to ask for dessert so we could head on our way. The Brownie Cookie Stack arrived at our table with fanfare. A huge firework candle drew the attention from the tables around us as it arrived. It would be great for a birthday party or function, but as a regular dessert accompaniment it was a little over the top. Again, we were pleasantly surprised by the portion size, a stack of 4 huge, thick brownie and chocolate chip cookies with vanilla ice cream and raspberry drizzle, all for $10. Although the presentation was amazing, the ice cream and sauce just couldn't bring out enough from the cookies, which were warm but weren't very moist or chewy.\n\nOverall, the food is comparable to a lot of nightclub-restaurants on King Street in Toronto but at a more affordable price range, and without the 60-minute wait for a table. The service was great, from the manager to the hostesses we felt very welcomed at the restaurant. &Company would be an awesome spot to celebrate your birthday, family function or company party but if you are looking for an intimate dinner party or a romantic evening, this might not be the best choice.","useful":8,"funny":2,"cool":3}

It's likely that you've heard of it, or at least driven by and noticed the huge signage. It's become somewhat of a Leslieville landmark.\n\nFirst things first, I've heard a lot of negative comments about this place. By the sounds of it, it's one of those places that's hit-or-miss and completely different from one visit to the next; amazing one time, awful the next. Because I've never had dinner there, I can't vouch for evening dining, but I can say this: if you truly don't want run the risk of being disappointed, stick with their weekend brunch. This place is known for brunch. While they may have their issues, Joy Bistro has no problems delivering an upscale brunch experience that is chock full of style.\n\nBrunch at Joy Bistro is not really bistro-ish. The brunch food here is mostly just what you'd expect to see on a brunch menu in most Toronto restaurants, but they do their brunch stuff particularly well. Eggs benny is served up in numerous styles like Benetine (with spinach and peameal bacon), Norwegien (with stacked smoked salmon), and Teddy (with peameal bacon, roasted tomatoes, and spinach). With their near-perfect hollandaise, eggs benny at Joy Bistro is a solid choice.\n\nThat, and they've got a killer patio. Intimate and relaxing, their patio is probably one of the best things about this place and the likely reason that a lot of people still frequent it even after having poor experiences. Leslieville has got a few patio spots, but for sheer space, warmth, and location sitting on a busy little Leslieville corner overlooking Jimmie Simpson Park, Joy Bistro's patio is in a league of its own. Worth the sit down in the summer.\n\nThey've recently undergone mass renos, which has resulted in Joy Bistro Bar. Although this may have helped the space modernize, it's also contributed to changing their clientele base. Neighbourhood locals that frequented Joy over the years seem to have gone looking for other spots while those looking for a more trendy experience seem to take over. I guess as Leslieville becomes more popular, Joy Bistro wants to change with the nighbourhood, and while change can be good, in most cases, if it isn't broke them why fix it?\n\nDespite that new clientele, it's still a great place for brunch. So the next time a nice, summer weekend rolls around, head out to Joy Bistro for brunch on the patio. By the sounds of it though, I certainly wouldn't do anything but brunch.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":2}

Maybe its the changing of the seasons, and I'm subconsciously trying to carbo-load for the winter months ahead and preparing for hibernation. Whatever it is, this past Monday I was looking for just that at Terroni on Queen West.\n \nThe camp is divided on Terroni. People either rave about it or complain about the pretentious servers, the 'no-substitution' rule, or the slice-it-yourself pizza. Being a fan of this place, I have a rebuttal for each of these complaints. \n\nWhile (some of) the servers may seem a bit curt at first, I owe this to the fact that Terroni is busy - always busy - and their no-nonsense attitude is often mistaken for pretentiousness. Our server, although brusque, took our order diligently while complementing our choices, had our wine to the table in no time, and managed to pour two glasses of the stuff from the awkwardly shaped porcelain decanter without dribbling it everywhere (which is something we later failed to do). \n\nAs for the no-subsitutions rule, if you want to choose your own toppings, then head on down to that infamous sub-par pizza joint (you know the one...with its orange boxes and redundant title) and stuff your crust while you're at it. Since when did slicing pizza become a chore? Just a few simple back and forth motions with a knife and voila! Freshly sliced pizza.  \n  \nRegardless of the division, Terroni is always packed. Monday at 9:00 found us one free table upstairs, which was where our preference lay anyway. Although I do love to pull up to the bar, it tends to get a bit clustered on the lower level, and while the upstairs isn't exactly quiet, shouting across the table isn't required. \n\nOur waiter promptly brought us the menus and we poured over the apps and the twenty-nine - yes, twenty-nine - pizzas they have to offer.  \n\nWe started with the Funghi Assoluti ($12.95):  breaded and baked oyster mushrooms served on arugula, sprinkled with parmesan, and drizzled with a balsamic glaze.  It was superb, but sharing proved to be problematic, not because the portion wasn't large enough, but because we simply didn't want to. Social graces saved us, but I had visions of the two of us in an Animal Planet-esque showdown... circling the last mushroom with fangs bared and hackles raised. \n \nWe chased all of this down with a velvety Piemonte that was oddly served in a jug, which made it difficult to pour. Our server made it look effortless, but us? Well, we just made a mess. I did manage to solve the problem however (pour from the side, and not from the oddly shaped lip) and fortunately for us we had a seemingly bottomless half litre.\n \nNo sooner had we finished sharing the last 'shroom was our pizza delivered to the table. We went with the Primavera ($15.95) to contribute to our daily recommended dose of veggies and to somehow convince ourselves that we were being healthy. All of the pizza at Terroni is thin crust and ours was weighed down heavily with tomatoes, red pepper, (more) mushrooms, and artichokes with a few black olives decorating the centre of the pie. \n\nNow when I say thin-crust, I mean it.  Maybe I'm just speaking for myself here, but I have absolutely no difficulty finishing a whole pizza without any assistance at Terroni. I'm a big fan of folding slices before biting into them, and the crust at Terroni is so thin and pliable I always envision myself folding a whole pizza in half,...and then in half again...and then having my way with it.  Once again, as with the sharing, social norms seem to get in the way...","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1}

Last month, David Chang, founder of Momofuku and internationally renowned chef, was in Toronto to play host in an unexpected arena: The TIFF Food on Film series. He joined a sold-out theatre of fellow foodies (including us) to watch his favourite culinary film, Ang Lee's \"Eat Drink Man Woman\", and then engaged the audience in an informal Q&A session that spanned topics ranging from film to the trappings of celebrity chef-hood.\n\nThree hours of salivating over delectable Chinese food on the screen left us craving more than popcorn, so we decided to check out Chang's Momofuku Daisho shortly after...\n\nMomofuku Daisho's ambience is definitely the highlight of the experience. It's open concept and top to bottom glass gives it a simplistic, modern feel. After a successful debut in NYC & Sydney, Chang was lured to Toronto by what he says was a 'perfect and unique' opportunity presented by the Shangrila Hotel: to house three, different takes on his cooking in 1, single building.\n\nWith the accessible Noodle Bar already a favourite of ours and a recent lacklustre (and wallet-busting) venture to the top-rated Shoto, we were eager to try our hand at Momofuku Daisho a mid-level offering that centers the menu around pre-ordered, 'family-style' dishes.\n\nAs you can probably imagine, it can be challenging enough to pick options in the moment, let alone coordinate an order for our group of 7 a week in advance (of which we were), but eager to get the full experience, we pre-ordered the much hyped about fried chicken and beef short ribs. The waitress kindly cautioned us to tread lightly when considering the rest of our order, on account of the deluge of food on the way. (Warning: Consider your wallet and alternative menu opportunities prior to committing to the pre-order. On a do-over, we would have banked one family style dish and ordered the rest off the menu.\n\nFirst we enjoyed two dishes of lightly pickled, chilli-infused cucumbers. If these cucumbers are the Asian take on 'bread and butter' the West is in more trouble than economists predict!\n\nNext came the Spicy Sausage and Rice Cake dish, inspired by Chinese Szechuan cuisine: these melt-in-your-mouth rice cakes punctuated by spiced sausage and Asian greens are a quintessential menu creation, packing flavour of Momofukian proportions!\n\nWe then indulged in a Momofuku classic: a pork-style bun, this time of the deboned chicken wing variety, coupled with dill, a glazey hot sauce and crudité; a real crowd pleaser for our group of 7.\n\nAnd then, the massive plate of fried chicken arrived in all of its glory. Included with vegetables, scallion pancakes (oily and delicious) and a fancy soya type sauce.\n\nLastly, we tried the beef ribeye shortribs flanked by white Kimchi, bean sprouts and some sticky white rice. In our not-so-humble opinion, the ribs were a tad on the fatty side,\n\nWe decided to end the night right and order the chocolate - five different textures of it. A healthy spectrum of liquid to solidity; an interesting experience, but we'd suggest the more intimate smaller size, even for a larger group like ours.\n\nAll in all, we were blissfully overfed at Momofuku Daisho. It was lovely dining with David Chang in town and we luckily caught him at the restaurant to snap a pic. Good friends and good food - what could be better?","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

It draws you in as soon as you enter, and it gives you the feeling that you're in for something special.\n\nWith considerate, friendly, detail orientated staff, the service at Globe doesn't disappoint. While it might have partly been because we were among the first tables they had in for dinner that night, we were warmly greeted by the entire front house as we were led to our table. No matter what business you're in, that type of attention scores big points.\n\nTrouble is, I was there to eat, and most of the food at Globe fell a little flat...\nThere's a lot to be said about going local. With hype from the 100 Mile Challenege and a seemingly growing concern for eating local and sustainable, people are looking for food that's produced closer to home and with a smaller carbon footprint. While Globe's focus may be on local, it's hard to identify exactly how close 'local' is since they have items sourced from as far as Kelowna and Vancouver.\n\nThe West Coast Dungeness Crab starter was overcomplicated, which made it slightly hard to identify what the heck we were eating. Besides the obvious crab meat, which was subtly sweet and perfectly cooked, the plate also had a far-to-large savoury panna cotta and some haphazardly scattered popcorn. Yep. Popcorn. While the consistencies were actually pretty good, it was mostly a confusing dish to eat that came with no explanation.\n\nThe Second Winds Farm Elk main was a little too simple; too little color, not enough flavor, and effortless presentation. While the elk loin was perfectly cooked, the braised shoulder was tough and near-tasteless. The best part of the dish was the corn polenta.\n\nMuch the same with the pheasant, which also served the meat two ways. While the citrus breast was moist and tasty, the jerked leg was tough and lacking spices.\nIt's really too bad, because I truly wanted to love Globe. From the beautiful dining room to the amazing staff, I was sure I was in for something special.\n\nPerhaps simpler is better, especially since what we're talking about here is a focus on local ingredients. Great cooking is all about balance, and if Globe could just work on simplifying some of their dishes (like the crab starter) and making others slightly more complicated (like the Elk main) and identify where they draw the line on being local, they'd have nothing stopping them.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Yes, it is completely pitch-black, and no, your eyes will not eventually adjust. You can't see a dam thing down there in O.Noir's dark and dingy basement dining room.\n\nSeriously though, O.Noir is easily one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had in Toronto, not just because the food and service were awful, but also because I left the place feeling ripped off. O.Noir took a concept that could have been interesting and did absolutely nothing with it. It was nothing more than eating crappy food in a dark basement room with the lights off.\n\nFirst off, the food at O.Noir is horrible. It's just glorified, hotel banquet food. You know the stuff: salad with balsamic vinaigrette, pre-cooked steam-table-held vegetables, chicken with coriander sauce. It was all of those boring old courses served at weddings and buffets in the 80s and 90s; there's nothing imaginative going on in the kitchen here. The food had absolutely no bearing on eating in an environment void of light. You'd think that if they were going to block your sense of sight, they'd want to serve food that would heighten your other senses, like food with strong aromas or flavours. Nope. Just unthoughtful, crappy food. In a way, the food was so bad that I'm glad my other senses weren't heightened by the lack of light.\n\nI ordered the 'surprise' menu. I mean really, why wouldn't I? I'd like to at least try to see if I could use my 'enhanced' senses to not only guess but also to better appreciate whatever it was I was eating... For me, the 'surprise' was that I still don't know what the hell I ate. No one ever told me. I sort of assumed that once we were finished eating, the server would have at least told those of us that ordered the surprise what it was we ate so that we could confirm our suspicions, but nope, he just took our plates away without any explanation at all.\n\nSpeaking of our server, he was one of the worst in the biz. Not only did he not bring us anything to drink until we were finished our first course and constantly get our orders mixed up, but he was inattentive and bored; I don't blame him though, it'd be hard not to be bored down there in the dark dining pit of O.Noir. He often left us wondering where he was, not because we were in the dark, but because he often left the room or crept up behind us.\n\nThe seating arrangements leave you feeling bored and isolated too, especially if you're part of a group. In a dark environment, you'd be better off sitting at a round table so that everyone can be part of the conversation. Our seating arrangements at a long, rectangular table left those on the end of the table feeling isolated and alone.\n\nSitting near the entrance to the dining room sucks too. Believe it or not, the servers actually signal that they're entering the room by banging on the door. We must have heard it 40 or 50 times. In a room that is supposed to heighten your senses, this seems absolutely ridiculous. Surely there must be a better way to enter the room and make sure that no light enters. If there is, O.Noir didn't figure it out, or they didn't care. They just decided to stick with the loud banging.\n\nAlthough we couldn't see anything, a quick feel confirmed that we were using those cheapo hotel-style metal chairs and wooden tables. I mean, I know we can't see anything anyways, but if our senses were supposed to be heightened, then surely our sense of touch should be a part of that. You could argue that because you're eating in the dark, the restaurant doesn't need to spend as much on the space, but I'd argue that because you're eating in the dark, the restaurant needs to spend more on the space and everything in the environment needs to be taken into consideration.\n\nOn the way out, the bartender asked us if we were staying in the attached hotel, and right then, it all made sense to me; this place was taking up the old banquet facilities of the hotel. It explains the strange layout the dining room has and the trend of hotel food and furniture. It confirmed one thing for me: if you're going to have a restaurant where your guests eat in the dark, then the space definitely needs to be built specifically for that purpose. There's little doubt that because they didn't, O.Noir sees little repeat business. People come for the novelty, but likely leave disappointed.\n\nO.Noir offers nothing more than eating crappy banquet food in a dark basement with the lights off; absolutely nothing more than that. The pitch-black did nothing to make the experience better or heighten my senses in anyway. I was just eating crappy banquet food in the dark...","useful":15,"funny":3,"cool":1}

This was the case a few days back when a number of friends thought it would be fun to get together at Axis Gastropub on the corner of Bloor and Markham in Mirvish Village.\n\nAxis sits in the old Rocco's Plum Tomato location and is the sister pub to Axis Gallery and Grill in the Junction. This corner seems to be one of the those 'Bermuda Triangle' hospitality locations, with new establishments failing to get a foothold over and over again. Maybe the Axis folks will succeed where others have not.\n\nArriving, a number of us remarked that the large room, decorated in a modern style, was a little stark and very empty for the time of day. It certainly didn't scream 'Pub'.\n\nWithin seconds we were greeted by the two servers\/bartenders and warmly directed to sit wherever we'd like. Both of these guys seemed genuinely happy to see us and quickly told us about the pint special for the day.\n\nTaking a large table in the back of the room, we sat, chatted and waited for our drinks that soon appeared.\n\nPerusing the menu, it was soon clear that this place was trying to please everyone. The choice was almost limitless with the usual pub fare coupled with 'build your own' pizzas and an entrees list that went from curries to fish and all the way back to steak and pasta.\n\nAt the server's recommendation we tried the Pulled Pork Nachos. What came was a healthy portion topped with a mound of pork and all the normal nacho toppings. Tasty, but not remarkable in any way, and the amount of topping-less dead space at the bottom was quite disappointing. Hot wings soon appeared followed by a number of comments of: 'Okay', 'Not stellar', 'Not that spicy'. Following another suggestion, my Axis Club sandwich soon arrived. A Pub staple, the clubhouse has almost as many variations as there are pubs. This club was well prepared, but again not remarkable. Combining chicken breast, ham and bacon on whole wheat bread it was pretty standard, much like what you'd find in a veteran diner or truck stop.\n\nOverall, Axis Gastropub does not live up to its name. It doesn't really feel like a Pub and there isn't anything remarkable about the food. Maybe it is a case of higher expectations, but I can't imagine returning when there are so many other better options nearby.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":2}

It's a fun way to people watch, without really having to watch out for them, but it's also a great way to spot new businesses, or old ones for that matter.  The past couple of times I took this trip, I wondered what was in the chalkboard-black building on the corner of Queen and Elm Grove.  I assumed it was a gallery given it was such a big space, and I was half right.  The Mascot is a coffee shop that showcases art...or an art gallery that serves coffee, depending on what you're going for I guess.  I myself was going for the coffee.\n\nAt first the place is a bit daunting.  It's quite large, with a lot of negative space, and very limited seating.  There are two barstools at the counter, a few tables that can seat more than one, and a surprisingly comfy blue velvet couch in the front room, but patrons need to be ready to get creative if all of those are taken.  The back room, which houses the artwork offers up a couple Victorian chairs for those who feel like working on their posture, an old elementary school chair\/desk combo, and a springy antique rocking horse (???).  I'm not quite sure if that last option is for display only, or for those who like their coffee with a little bouncy nostalgia, but I for one wasn't about to find out.  I used to have one of those horses, and I remember getting pinched by the damn springs on a regular basis.  Luckily for us, there was a free table.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered a latte while I went with just a basic drip to see what Reunion Island coffee is like in its most vulnerable state.  I should've went with the latte.  Not that the drip was bad, but the latte was fantastic. It was smooth and strong without being bitter. The Rosetta adorning the foam was a nice touch as well.  (It should be noted that I went back a few days later for my very own).  \n\nAs it was around the brunch hour, and breakfast had long worn off we decided to get a couple of treats to go with our coffee.  The edible portion of the menu at The Mascot is provided by OMG Baked Goods, and like the seating, selection is limited.  The cupcakes were tempting but we were in the mood for savoury, so we ordered a ham & cheese quiche along with a stuffed foccacia.\n\nThe quiche arrived looking a little bit sad and we faced off as to who would try it first.  We both agreed that it was tastier than we would have guessed, but I've definitely had better quiche.  The stuffed foccacia on the other hand was a nice surprise.  It didn't come to the table looking like much... really just a bun on a plate.  But as with all things stuffed, it's what's inside that counts.  Filled with roasted peppers, artichokes and Asiago cheese, it was not unlike a grown-up Hot Pocket...one that got tired of all the negative attention so it moved out of its parents freezer, and adopted a healthier lifestyle.  The quiche was pushed aside, but later finished - out of hunger alone. \n\nFood however is an afterthought at The Mascot.  From what I saw, the people of Parkdale go for the coffee, and rightly so.  There was a steady stream of people coming and going, and judging by the interactions, quite a few regulars.  With friendly laid-back staff, good ambience and amazing lattes, I would make it my local too - if only I lived anywhere near it.\n\nFootnote:  Seating doubles in the warmer months, when it's comfortable enough to sit on the driftwood looking bench that runs the length of their storefront.  Another good place to do some people watching.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Let me tell you why... One hot and muggy Saturday evening, I found myself walking down College Street in search of sustenance and something cold to slake my thirst. Now, I'm notorious for my inability to make a decision when faced with many options, and College Street has a lot to offer in the way of restaurants. I passed by bistro after restaurant after lounge, growing hungrier by the minute. How did I choose? Divine intervention lent me a helping hand as the sky opened up and let loose a torrential downpour sending me running into the open arms (see: doorway) of Utopia.\n\nIt was already jam packed, which had nothing to do with the rain. There was a line-up for tables, but I managed to grab a seat at the bar to peruse both the menu and the environment. What is it about exposed brick and hardwood floors that make a place so cozy? Whatever it is, Utopia has both.\n\nNeedless to say, I was immediately enamoured, and when I opened the menu, that bubble remained intact. Now, I wouldn't call myself a vegetarian, nor would I dive into a steak with gusto, so for a selectavarian such as myself, I couldn't have designed a more heavenly menu if I tried. All but three of their appetizers are meat free, and they allow you to substitute soy (grilled or breaded & fried) for meat in most of their main dishes. Meat lovers and vegetarians unite!\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, it gets even better! I forgot to mention earlier that in between appreciating the exposed brick and opening the menu, I honed in on the beer selection (tunnel vision at its finest). And it made me smile, for they had KLB Raspberry Wheat on tap. Typically, I like my beer to taste like, well...beer, but I make an exception for KLB, especially in the summertime (although I find excuses to drink it at other points in the year) as the natural raspberry essence paired with the beer itself is possibly the most refreshing combination ever. Like angels dancing on my tongue...delicious, raspberry angels. Its difficult to find on tap, and Utopia has it, so I chalk them up some more points.\n\nI started with the Mumahari Dip (roasted red peppers, pomegranate molasses and walnuts) that comes served with naan. While the dip itself wasn't exactly visually appealing (but really how many dips are?) with a likening to cat food, I was willing to overlook it. The Everlasting Gobstopper of dips, every bite of the Mumahari started sweet, moved onto nutty and finished with a bit of a kick. Delish.\n\nBetween the dip and the KLB, I was already very satisfied, but I wasn't done yet. Next came my Grilled Veggie & Goat Cheese Burrito. I love a good burrito, and this one didn't disappoint. Grilled zucchini, red peppers, eggplant, onions and a generous layer of goat cheese came wrapped in a soft tortilla. Served alongside substantial sides of both garden salad and rice, I couldn't finish it if I tried...and I tried. There is absolutely nothing wrong with leftovers though, and I can vouch that a Utopia burrito tastes just as delicious the day after.\n\nOn a tight budget? All of Utopia's mains hover around the $13 mark which in my opinion is a great deal considering the quality of the food and the very sizeable portions. I can easily see two people splitting a burrito and leaving the place with full stomachs (and wallets). The only problem with this scenario however, is the lack of leftovers.\n\nIf Utopia has any drawbacks, it's that the place is hot in the summer - really, really hot. The lack of air-conditioning combined with the open kitchen may have something to do with it. If I were anywhere else, I just may have been uncomfortable, but I had my pint of KLB, exposed brick, and a smiling bartender that made me feel like I was the only person in the room (okay...now I'm just getting carried away, but that being said the service is genuinely warm). Looking around, even though everyone had a sheen to them, nobody seemed to mind. Everybody just looked happy. People don't sweat at Utopia...they glow.\n\nFor a pasta-heavy neighbourhood, Utopia provides a nice deviation. It's the kind of place I could eat at everyday, so it's probably a good thing I don't live nearby, but it will definitely be my College Street go-to. They also have a four season patio (another good reason I don't live in the area, as much to my liver's chagrin, I have an almost instinctual draw to drinking outside).\n\nUtopia is a contradiction unto itself: it's frenetic, but it's calm; blazers sit next to longboarders; meat lovers co-exist amongst vegetarians; it's hot, but oh so cool. As its name implies, this Bohemian spot in Little Italy is truly ideal.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":2}

What makes the experience at Nota Bene so incredible is the total lack of pretense in a restaurant that could easily come across as pompous, and still attract a devoted clientele.\n\nYou might find yourself dining with a local politician or celebrity, and a couple celebrating their wedding anniversary, all in the same place. The price is accessible, the quality of the food impeccable, and the service instant without being overwhelming.\n\nWe started the evening with Chef David's lobster tacos and the margarita fiesta specials. The lobster tacos were served in a lettuce shell, with a chipotle cream, veggies and cilantro ($8). They tasted like something you would find in a great coastal city, and not at all heavy. The lobster special is a great way to settle in to a long evening of wonderful food.  The margaritas were phenomenal, served on the rocks with Avion tequila. We tried a couple of the cocktails and loved \"Chef David's\" traditional margarita with smoked sea salt. The blueberry and pine tips margarita sounds like a bit of an odd marriage, but worked so wonderfully together that we ordered another.\n\nFor appetizers we started with the Hamachi ceviche, which is a yellowtail Pacific fish, infused with coriander, lime, avocado, and jalapeño ($16). This dish came highly recommended by our server, and was absolutely worth the hype. The jalapeños offered a very spicy take on the dish, tempered by the avocado and lime.\n\nNext we tried the cavatelli pasta, with a truffle-scented mushroom Bolognese ($16). This dish was surprisingly soft and creamy without any cheese in it, and the truffle mushrooms were divine. We also had the crisp duck salad with sumac green papaya slaw and cashews ($15), and although I am self-admittedly duck averse, I am told it was perfectly crispy and flavourful, and ending up being the favourite appetizer of the evening for my companion.\n\nFor our mains we ordered two Nota Bene favourites. I went with the wild Digby sea scallops with avocado purée, Thai curry paste, mango, papaya and peanut salad ($28). For such a tropical sounding dish, the scallops actually had a very Canadian East coast feel to them, the avocado puree adding a creamy compliment to the scallops. Nota Bene specializes in preparing excellent seafood, and I would absolutely come back for this dish again.\n\nWe also tried the braised beef short rib with corn truffle, pickled red onions, queso añejo and coriander ($29). The short ribs were tender, succulent and combined with the sharp taste of the queso añejo and the acidity of the pickled red onion, they were layered with flavour and flat out delicious.\n\nWith dinner, we ordered a glass of Ontario Pinot Noir and an Argentinean Malbec. The wine list at Nota Bene is extensive, with the full spectrum of bottles, ranging from the $70 to several hundred.\n\nFor dessert we sampled sticky toffee pudding ($12) and S'More ice cream ($10). Needless to say, the sampling turned into finishing. Both desserts were exploding with flavour, the pudding a great combination of traditional pecan praline and spotted dick ice cream, taken with a strong espresso; this is dessert to die for. The S'More ice cream was a fun take on the campfire favourite, with a chocolate and graham cracker crumble.\n\nGo try Nota Bene, twice.  Once to become familiar with all that this brilliantly conceived restaurant has to offer and then a second time to cement the relationship in your black book of regular haunts. Service, quality and ambience are all top rate, yet you still feel the passion Nota Bene has for creating a wonderful experience and forming personal relationships with its guests.\n\nSee you there...","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I've been looking through what other people have said about Megas, and it's all so bad...really bad. That's where the trouble comes in for me, because I certainly didn't hate it as much as everyone else seems to. In fact, I actually thought I was going to be giving Megas more then 3 stars with this review. Why? This is the second time I've been to Megas. I was only going again because it was so good the first time. But the second time wasn't even a close second.\n\nThe big plus Megas has got going for them is their killer patio right on the busier stretch of the Danforth. It's probably one of the best places to sit outdoors on the street. It's a big, covered space that's chock full of people, and at first glance, is difficult not to gravitate towards on a sunny day. \n\nOnce you get over the patio though, and it comes to eating, you're likely to be disappointed; but it's completely dependent on what you order and when you order it. The food at Megas is mostly mediocre, but there are a couple things worth mentioning. While the rice is of the reheated, overcooked, slightly warmed kind, the Saganaki (fried Feta cheese made of sheep's milk) and Taramosalata (Cod caviar spread) is probably some of the best on The Danforth. Seriously, if you have never tried either of these, this is the place to do it. But everything else, order with caution. This place is completely hit or miss, mostly depending on how busy they are.\n\nThe inside is sorta your typical Greek place: fake roman statues, stone pillars, and lots of greenery; it's a big space too. If you check it out on the weekend, chances are that big space will have more than one big group, which Megas can provide for comfortably. But that's where most of their issues lie. While they may be able to provide for big groups, it's at the sacrifice of all the other tables. Once Megas gets busy, the service, food quality, and overall experience seemingly drops right through the floor.\n\nUnfortunately, the one thing that is truly consistent at Megas no matter how many times you go there is their lack of caring for food presentation. While most of the stuff they serve seems to be haphazardly dropped on the plate, I don't blame Megas for that. After all, that's pretty much a standard for Greek food; it never seems to be about the presentation. When it comes to Greek food, there's never really a big surprise with what you end up with at your table. You order calamari? It's probably served garnished with parsley and olive oil. You order hummus? It's probably served garnished with olive oil and a lone Kalmata olive. The only difference varying from place to place is whether it's tasty enough to be worth eating.\n\nI'm still slightly confused about whether to recommend this place or not. I mean, they've got a few things going for them. Like I said, the first time was pretty good, and if I knew I was guaranteed that every time, I'd have no problems returning.  Megas basically comes down to this: if the place isn't busy, stop in and check it out; if they are busy, keep walking.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1}

Without giving you an exact number of how many years it's been, I will tell you that Gap wanted everyone in khakis, pagers weren't quite obsolete, and Mambo #5 was tearing up the charts.  So thankfully a lot has changed, but two things remain, and will always remain the same, about student life.  Number one:  students are broke.  Number two:  they are hungry.  Say Cheese is going to make many U of T students very happy. \n\nI haven't met a grilled cheese sandwich I didn't like, and I haven't met anyone that doesn't like a grilled cheese sandwich.  That might be why so many gourmet grilled cheese places are popping up these days, but it's a risky business.  The people have spoken and they want grilled cheese sammies...but they don't want to pay a lot for them.  After all, you can make a perfectly good one at home with white bread, and cheese that's more plastic than it is dairy.  And that's where Say Cheese comes in.  Nigel Koo, part owner and operator wants to satisfy stomachs without putting a dent in wallets.  He doesn't see why he can't serve up a high quality sandwich at a low(ish) cost and have customers walking out in a lactose induced ecstasy.\n\nIt was quiet when I arrived but word wasn't really out yet, and the boys were still experimenting in their test kitchen.  I was happy to be a guinea pig.  I asked to try their most popular meat and veggie options, and this is what followed.  \n\nI started with Indira's Pulled Pork made with Beemster.  Diners can choose to have regular cheese, such as cheddar, on their sandwich ($6.50) or upgrade to a premium choice ($8.50). My creation came topped with homemade mac & cheese (fun!) on whole wheat bread.  I only ate half as I had more coming my way, but the sandwiches here are generous, and I had to pace myself.  The different textures paired nicely, but I would have liked it more had the meat been a touch saucier, or came with something in which to dip it.\n\nNext, came the Italian Classic.  Not that I'm taking bets, but if you put Buffalo mozzarella on anything, I will eat it.  So I was pleased when they said one of their best meatless sellers was filled with the stuff.  I like a good Margharita pizza, and this was the sandwich version.  \n\nAs if that wasn't enough (and by all dietary standards, it was more than that) I was offered their dessert sandwich.  It didn't take a lot of prodding, and went something like this;\n\n Nigel:  You should try our dessert option. \n\n Me:  Wow, I don't know.  I'm really stuffed.  Okay.\n\nThe French Grilled Toast is like a ménage a trois between a grilled cheese, some French toast, and a piece of cheesecake. It's good.  Scary good.  Filled with ricotta, mascarpone and a berry compote, the sandwich is then dusted with turbinado sugar, and drizzled with maple syrup.  As with French toast, this needed to be eaten with a knife and fork, which probably worked in my best interest as it stopped me from inhaling it.  I will be going back for this one.  As it is now, I think about it more than anyone should think about a sandwich.\n\nSo in total I ended up eating just a little bit more than a full sandwich thanks to the few bites I had of the French toast, and I was beyond full.  So much so, that I actually skipped dinner that night. Now by my calculations, that equals two meals for the price of one, and a low price at that.

After all, the arrival of littlefish in the Junction has definitely been well received. The neighbourhood has been waiting an awfully long time for a cool, hipster-worthy brunch spot. Unfortunately, the arrival of littlefish hasn't completely filled that void just yet. They still have a few kinks to work out, but don't give up on them yet. I won't, but only because I really want to love it.\n\nOk. First off, this is a pretty cool restaurant. Besides the obviously brilliant name, littlefish is a great little place to grab weekend brunch. It's small, only about 8 tables or so, but that just makes it all-the-more cozier and comfortable. It's a long, narrow space filled with exposed red brick and shiny metal airducts. The daily specials, scrawled and displayed on a suspended chalkboard, are imaginative, original, and well-thought-out.\n\nThe brunch menu is pretty much what you'd expect to see. They have everything from French toast and eggs benedict to pancakes and crepes. Best of all, they seem to make everything from scratch with good ingredients.\n\nThe staff goes out of their way to be friendly and to make sure you have everything you need to feel comfortable. Constantly being checked on, I never found myself without a full cup of hot coffee, but I suppose that's sort of expected in a place that only seats about 30 people.\n\nThe thing that's not expected in a place this size is the ridiculous wait time for food. When I was there, it seemed as though everyone in the whole place waited 45 minutes to an hour for their orders to arrive; I know I definitely did. If they were understaffed, I couldn't understand it; there were at least 5 people in the exposed kitchen, none of them seeming to be moving with any sense of urgency. Definitely not understaffed here. The whole place seemed to be in a state of organized chaos. The front counter was covered with papers and dishes, and the visible part of the kitchen was overcrowded with food containers and crowded counterspaces. Organized chaos, but just barely contained.\n\nPeople rave about the food here, but I really don't see it. My eggs benny was, meh, ok, but they certainly weren't anything to get excited about. They were warm but not hot, and the side of potatoes was mostly burned. My daughter had their now 'Internet famous' French toast. With burned edges on an overcrowded plate, they were even less than meh.\n\nMake no mistake though, this place was busy. Newcomers are put on a couch to wait until a table vacates, but they are offered coffee. If you're planning on getting a table on the weekend, be prepared to wait. So why so busy? Personally, I think a lot of it has to do with the neighbourhood's lack of options. I'd be willing to bet that although littlefish may be doing well in the Junction, had they been on a more brunch heavy area, like West Queen West, they may not be doing as well as they are now.\n\nSo would I go back to littlefish? Sure. I'd like to give them another chance. I think the whole neighbourhood would. After all, the Junction needs a place like littlefish as much as littlefish needs a neighbourhood like the Junction.","useful":7,"funny":1,"cool":2}

By top-notch, I mean pizza that is served sizzling and fresh and made with high-quality ingredients. Pizza like that is true craftsmanship; pizza like that I could eat every day. In my continuing effort to find superior pizza, I looked to Lil' Baci in Leslieville. My visit didn't disappoint me.\n\nLil' Baci's dining room is a decent-sized dining space, but the tables are packed pretty tight, so don't expect too much privacy. You'll likely hear everything that the table next to you is talking about. If you need to escape your neighbour table, in the warmer months you may want to check out the cute backyard patio. Comfortable, busy, and social, it's the place to be when the sun is out.\n\nWhen I'm eating Italian food, I like to start off with a glass of red vino or cold Italian beer. Lil' Baci's wine list is small but thorough and their beer list offers some nice Italian choices; Moretti and Perroni are my personal favourites.\n\nLil' Baci has a seriously amazing dandelion greens salad.  If you've never had dandelions as food before, this would be the one to expose yourself to it. The greens are slightly bitter, but the bitterness works well topped with shaved Parmigiano, cracked black pepper, and freshly squeezed lemon. Perfect starter.\n\nAnd the pizza, they do it right. Lil' Baci has a savoury and seasoned tomato sauce base that expertly compliments the four cheeses that are layered on their Quattro Fromagi; my personal favorite.  They've got some other really outstanding pizzas to choose from like the Margherita (with tomato, basil, and mozza), the Lil' Baci (with pecorino, sausage, and fennel pollen), and the Gorgonzola Dolce (with gorgonzola, Yukon gold potatoes, and caramelized onions). All of their pizzas are served on signature thin crust dough that is seared and blistered perfectly.\n\nLil Baci has got a really small pasta menu. Ridiculously small. There's only three items. But still, these 3 items are done perfectly. They're all made with quality ingredients and use that great tomato sauce that's on the pizza. My favorite is just the plain ole' Spaghetti and meatballs.  It's got just the right amount of fresh basil, sauce, and Parmigiano. The portion size isn't huge, but with that dandelion salad and something from their Insalata menu, it's more than enough.\n\nLil' Baci also has a Panino menu, which surprisingly is different from their pizza menu. I love the Panino Tonnato. Packed with Italian tuna, caper aioli, sun-dried tomatoes and arugula, it's perfectly pressed into an amazing bite.\n\nThe dessert menu has a few options, but when I was there I had a lemon prosecco tart. The crust was buttery, but a tad on the dry side. The custard-like lemon filling had a refreshing prosecco flavour, which balanced the acidity nicely.\n\nI head to Lil' Baci when I want some decently priced Italian food and some amazing pizza. Lunch or dinner, what you end up with is a steal anywhere in the city!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":2}

That's usually a good sign, and in this case it's definitely true. But waiting for a table isn't all bad; there's lots to see in this place: kitchy cute decor and lots of memoribilia that reminded me of my childhood. When I was there, the place was cramped and full of hungry people, but everyone was in good spirits. \n\nWhen I look at the menu, i always find it difficult to make a choice. They've got a big, diverse menu with both savory and sweet items. All of it looks delicious.  \n\nFirst off, I'm a vegetarian, but, like to get the breakfast pocket, sans pemeal bacon of course.  It's chock full of fluffy eggs, caramelized onions, mayo and cheddar cheese on a warm and soft onion bun. Aunties and Uncles encourages you to choose between a few sides, but I've never chose anything but the potato salad. Seriously, this stuff is good. A great combo of chunky red potatoes, dill, Dijon and spices, it's savoury and creamy. Admittedly, my food did and usually does take a bit of time to arrive, so if you go, don't go when you're in a hurry.\n\nFruit juices and iced teas are good choices, but I wouldn't finish off with an espresso as they may suggest. Their espresso is nothing special and just plain weak, and it certainly doesn't stand up to Manic coffee located just a few doors down. If you're craving an after-meal-caffiene-fix, I'd suggest you head over to Manic.\n\nAunties and Uncles loses points in service. The service staff seem a bit cold, sorta aloof, and alot grouchy, but despite if you're willing to overlook that, then this is worth a visit if you're in the College & Bathurst area.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

You'd think that there wouldn't be much to be said about greasy Mexican food, but that doesn't seem to be true in La Hacienda's case. Not on my part though; they've got a pretty decent reputation online, particularly where weekend brunch is concerned. The Internet is full of lots of reviews, lots of check-ins, and lots of positive feedback.\n\nI'd say most of that good stuff online about them is dead wrong. \n\nLa Hacienda is a decent little place at first walk-in: cozy, dimly lit, the kinda place you'd expect to find on this stretch of Queen West. With a mostly-covered back patio full of comfortable seating and nicely placed greenery, it seems like the perfect place to hide on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nBut one thing is for sure, it isn't the perfect place to eat. The menu is mostly unimaginative with few signs of thought or effort. Boring chicken and beef burritos and greasy chorizo hash is what you'll be eating. Mostly everything comes with a side of their store bought corn chips and homemade salsa, but again, that salsa isn't made with any degree of love or passion for food; just a bunch of cubed tomatoes with little seasoning. La Hacienda sure doesn't have the fresh-chopped tomatoes and cilantro and killer guacamole you'd expect of a Mexican joint. This place doesn't have one dam authentic thing about it. \n\nPerfect for a hot, Sunday afternoon, they also serve in-house made Sangrias by the glass or pitcher. Unfortunately, they're far from perfect too. Cheap red wine, mixed with pre-frozen orange juice, and few bits of floating fruit, it's again, a big miss from the freshness most people associate with Sangrias. Call me crazy, but for 6 bucks a glass, I want some fresh-squeezed orange juice and fresh slices of orange and limes cut specifically for that purpose. I want the red wine they choose to have flavour that compliments citrus, not just whatever is laying around and recently opened.\n\nOn this particular day, La Hacienda was brutally understaffed with one server and one cook; hardly enough to accommodate the back-patio alone, nevermind the front of the place. While still friendly, the server was obviously struggling to keep everyone happy; never returning to check on how people liked their food, which I assume they didn't. She was so busy in fact, that I didnt even have the heart to tell her how crappy everything was for fear that one misguided detail like that would throw her off her game completely.\n\nSeriously, this place is should be on your avoid list. There is absolutely nothing special, or Mexican for that matter, about it at all. It's just greasy, over-priced, 'Mexican' themed food served in a hipster shop on Queen West. If you're looking for authenticity, you've got a ton of other way-better options in this city.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Despite the obvious assumptions, Murray does not take kindly to eating regular old hot dogs. He prefers a more delectable, refined meal. What does Murray like the most? Sandwiches, of course! In fact, he loves them so much that he  used all of his love and expertise to build a sandwich shop for his fellow sandwich lovers. Thus, Murray's Sandwich Emporium sprang to life.\n\nI recently found myself in the exact same conundrum as Murray the dog was; I was sick of my same-ol'-same-ol' packed lunches, and I was searching for something better. I know you're thinking that sandwiches have to be the most cliché lunch choice of them all, but one look at Murray's menu, and you'll know that you're in for something much different. \n\nThere is not a huge selection (by sheer number) at Murray's, but each item is unique, and there is a decent range of combinations across the board. There are meatless, chicken, beef, fish, cheese and even sweet sandwiches, plus a decent offering of sides (note: combos and sides are extra). \n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty simplistic. It's small, has exposed and undecorated brick walls and two large wooden tables with stools scattered around them. The chalkboard menu hangs on the wall, and there is a small refrigerator full of beverages just off to the side. It is all very subdued and quite appropriate for a sandwich shop.\n\nI held back a bit on my first trip to Murray's. I didn't really know what to expect, how big the servings would be, and what kind of value I would find there. I decided to go with The Uncle Phil: sliced ribeye, onions, green peppers and ooey, gooey, messy, melty provolone cheese on a beautiful baguette. \n\nTruthfully, I thought the bread was the best part of this sandwich. I don't feel bad for discounting the meat or toppings because, for sandwiches at least, the bread is just as much a star in the meal as anything else. The baguette was clearly very fresh, they keep it tender (but crispy) and most importantly, not over or under-stuffed. The meat was tender too, but it needed a bit more oomph. The green peppers were just slightly sautéed, giving them a nice crunch and, as mentioned above, the cheese was gloriously gooey. All of that was topped off with a pickle - for nine bucks!\n\nI felt that I didn't really get the whole experience of Murray's my first time around, so on my second visit I decided to get into some side dishes. I certainly didn't hold back on my sandwich choice with The BL-Tizzy - double smoked B, of course some L and T, house-made mayo, avocado and an egg (a $1.00 add-on). I threw all of that into a combo with some onion rings and a can of pop, bringing my total to $12 plus tax. This is a bit pricey in my opinion, but considering the amount of food they give you, it's not so bad. Here again, I thought the bread stood out more than anything else. It was so fresh and tasted of near perfection. Just like The Uncle Phil, the fillings were good but, other than the sheer volume, they were fairly regular...tasty, but regular.\n\nOverall, Murray's Sandwich Emporium offers a delicious product that is definitely over-sized and that will satisfy your hunger. Plus, they're open for lunch, dinner and late-night eats. However, as tasty as the sandwiches are, I can't say anything really blew me away. Yes, the menu item names are unique and fun and the serving sizes are huge, but nothing is really over the top. That being said, sometimes simple is best; they know what they're good at, they know how to make a good sandwich, and they're consistent. \n\nGood boy, Murray.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

I paid $22 for a burger lunch and am absolutely ok with it.\n\nGrindhouse is serious carnivore territory.\n\nThe first thing to stand out, though, was my drink. I went for my usual diet cola and I got, \"Sorry we don't have anything with aspartame.\" In fact, you shouldn't go there expecting to get your go-to big brand soft drink at all. Well, well, well I better go for something really interesting then. Boylan's Birch Beer - a root beer drink, sweetened with cane sugar, with pure vanilla extract and only one preservative (sodium benzoate, typically used in soft drinks and other acidic preserves). Their amazing dedication to fresh and natural ingredients obviously did not end there.\n\nAll of the ingredients are local and fresh, the burger meat comes from naturally raised livestock and is Genetically Modified Organism, hormone and antibiotic-free. You will not find anything that has refined sugars, or artificial sweeteners (hence the lack of Coca-Cola and Pepsi on the premises). They literally prepare everything in-house. The buns are made there and they also make the ketchup and mustard themselves, right in the back kitchen. The \"fresh and never frozen\" attitude is not good enough here; if you're going to do it, do it right.\n\nTheir burger creations are unique and creative; a turkey burger with black truffles and cranberries, yes they do have a veggie burger and it's soy-free and, my choice, the black and blue burger are just a few of the menu items. I was presented with a Cajun spiced beef patty smothered in blue cheese sauce and cooked only to medium, with a side of onion rings (who was I kidding with that diet cola anyway).\n\nIf you can be sure of the meat quality, requesting a burger cooked less than well-done will give you much more flavour and a better texture. On my first bite there was an immediate rush of barbecue charcoal flavour emanating from the patty; it tasted like summertime. The blue cheese sauce was mild and, considering the Cajun description, it was spiced, not spicy. The onion rings were huge and somehow satisfyingly greasy but unbelievably crispy.\n\nI actually don't often talk about presentation because, frankly, it's all about the taste for me. I have eaten enough beautiful yet disappointing and ugly yet amazing dishes to spend much time considering plating. However, the simple beauty of this burger and onion rings dish was lovely - just a white plate and a burger, without a toothpicked-pickle piercing the bun. Lovely.\n\nMuch like my University professors, I hesitate to give out a \"perfect\" score and I can't on good conscious say that this was the very best burger in the city, but - a big but - they gave me something pretty darn close to the best burger around and the attention paid to good, fresh and healthful ingredients truly impressed me.\n\nTheir name might be harsh and gory, but you'll find burger-fare inside that is gentle and kind to you and your body.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":1}

Being situated in a bit more of an upscale mall, Aux Delices caters to their clientele. Health conscious foodies will delight in their selection of fresh, gourmet ingredients, including Panini's, pastas, crepes, salads, and even specialties like duck l'orange and homemade gelato, just to name a few. There menu is ever changing, depending on seasonal availability, so there is always something new to try at Aux Delices.\n\nWe started our meal with the fresh manicotti and roasted mushroom caps, duck l'orange with mushroom and greens, and roasted eggplant salad. Everything tasted like fresh, home cooking. The manicotti ($6.50) was amazing, with melt-in-your-mouth ricotta, and ripe tomatoes that tasted like they were picked form the garden that morning. The stuffed Portobello mushroom cap with cheese and polenta was an awesome side dish, complementing the Italian flavours in the manicotti, but would be great as an entrée on its own.\n\nThe duck l'orange was cooked perfectly, tender and succulent, the sauce was sweet and tangy, and the accompanying side salads of oyster mushrooms and greens, and roasted eggplant were in a league of their own. I would have returned just to try a sampling of all their fresh veggie salads.\n\nNext up, a roasted vegetable Panini, recommended by our host. The yellow pepper, red onion and eggplant were soft and easy to eat, with a nice portion of goat cheese on lovely focaccia bread. Moving into crepe territory, we decided to tackle the ham and cheese crepe ($9.50), with tomatoes as well, and would go back for more. Their crepes are light and fluffy, and packed with ingredients. Even better, your crepe is made right in front of you, and you can add any ingredients you like. A fun experience for kids, too.\n\nFor those looking for the \"café\" experience, they serve up delightful illy coffee, and Rahier desserts, that almost make you feel like you are dining in Europe. Their double espressos were great, nice and bold, and the latte was perfect, frothy and steamed to perfection. The homemade gelato was amazing. I love ice cream, and have been a latecomer to the gelato trend, but I am glad that I tried it. We sampled the chocolate, vanilla and pistachio, a must when having gelato, and they were all very well done. The vanilla and chocolate especially, both true to their flavours, with a natural, nuttier taste, rather than overtly sweet.\n\nAux Delices Café offers a fabulous dining experience, and allows you to stop in for a fast and easy meal, or linger over a cup of coffee and a pastry. All of their meals are available to go, making it a great option to stop in after work for a ready-made meal.\nGourmet meals ready as soon as you order, great coffee and homemade gelato should have you stopping for a break on your next shopping trip.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Why are people flocking to these brightly coloured, frosted, palm-sized desserts? Well, I'm sure there is some greater social commentary to be made here about a reversion to childhood or a need for comfort foods in our over-stressed, over-worked lives, but, in the case of Prairie Girl Bakery, it's just simply that they taste so darn good!\n\nWalking into Prairie Girl Bakery is almost like entering a fine clothing store - everything is placed just so. The whole space is pristinely clean and clear of clutter; literally nothing exists except a counter and back-wall display. The cupcakes are kept safely behind the employees, lined up row by row waiting to be selected and boxed up. All of the focus is on their one and only product. There is no time wasted on brewing coffee, serving tea, or making sandwiches. Everything comes down to one thing: the cake and the icing.\n\nWhen I first walked into the store, I thought I made a mistake. I went in to grab a dozen cupcakes for a work function and was shocked at the lack of merchandise on the shelves. I had to ask, \"was I supposed to pre-order before coming in?\" Not at all. They just take extra care to provide the freshest product possible, promising never to serve a \"day-old cupcake.\" So, baking in big batches to keep the shelves stocked to the brim all day is out of the question. The team at Prairie Girl Bakery prides itself on being resourceful and limiting waste; they even take any leftover cupcakes to a local charitable organization, Toronto's Second Harvest, that is dedicated to providing realistic solutions to hunger. Are cupcakes a necessity for a charitable food organization? Of course not, but why not give where you can and provide something a bit more luxurious than canned food to those in need.\n\nThe cupcakes come in two sizes, 13 flavours, and an array of beautiful colours. You won't find any unneeded extras here, like (in)edible sugar flower toppings disguising an otherwise delectable treat. The cakes are simple and the swirls of icing are in the spotlight on top of light bases. The range of flavours include peanut butter banana, red velvet with classic cream cheese icing, chocolate-chocolate, chocolate-vanilla, chocolate-hazelnut, chocolate cake with peppermint icing, and my ultimate favourite, chocolate cake with strawberry icing. The strawberry colour was fairly mute, but the flavour was intense. Even more impressive was that the chocolate cake didn't overpower the icing or vice versa. Each deep flavour perfectly complemented the other.\n\nA dozen mini-cupcakes come in at $18.95 and one dozen regular size at $31.95. My gluttonous side will only order the mini cupcakes from now on, allowing me to eat two or three different flavours in one sitting. However, there is something supremely gorgeous about the sight of one of their regular sized cupcakes sitting in it's very own container (complete with viewing window) waiting only for you.\n\nWant to feel a little less guilty about completely indulging in these sinfully tasty treats? Prairie Girl Bakery's dedication to remaining as all-natural as possible streams throughout the whole operation. Not only do they use recyclable cardboard packaging, but they are absolutely free of preservatives, artificial flavours, and hydrogenated or \"trans\" fats. I'd say that's mostly healthy eating.\n\nOn one final note, I have to say that I love the mythology around this place. The story is that Prairie Girl Bakery's creator, Jean Blacklock, learned all she knew from her family back on her Saskatchewan farm. She eventually left a career in law to bring that down home prairie, old fashioned baking to us city-dwellers. I don't think there could possibly be more charm or more beauty in the simplicity of what Prairie Girl Bakery is and what they produce.","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":3}

Sitting in a little space out in the Bloor and Lansdowne, Nuthouse has established itself with Blansdowne locals as the best place around to pick up all sorts of interesting products.\n\nFirst thing you'll notice about Nuthouse is that it smells good...it smells really good...it smells like an incredibly nice mix of high-quality nuts, cereals, grains, teas, dried fruit, lentils, dried fruit, spices, cake, and coffee. It's a smell that right away makes you feel comfortable and assures you that what you're getting is filled with quality. Don't expect to see the typical bulk fare with hundreds of bins full of overly processed and mass-produced stuff; you're in the wrong place for that sorta thing. Nuthouse is full of nothing but always high quality and sometimes organic products.\n\nOk. That might not be the very first thing you notice. Chances are, if you're walking down Bloor looking for this place, or even if you're not looking for it, the first thing you'll notice won't even be inside the store; it'll be the big, plastic walnut hanging above the front doorway. That big walnut has become somewhat of a landmark item on this stretch of Bloor, even though they've only been in business for a few months.\n\nNuthouse isn't just about nuts. They carry all sorts of things, from organic candy and fair-trade coffee to raw cereals and handmade soap. And its healthy too. A lot of the stuff they carry is the sugar-free, vegan, raw, organic type of stuff, which makes it a super option for more health conscious people. And if you have dietary restrictions, Nuthouse has got you covered too with tons of gluten and wheat free products, like their spiced carrot cake. If that's your bag and you live in the area, you no longer need to travel far to get these kinda things.\n\nPersonally, when I think of organic or locally-sourced or handmade or any other related adjective used to describe stuff in a store like this, I unfortunately also think 'expensive'. At Nuthouse though, that really isn't the case. The prices are actually fairly down-to-earth and mostly afforable. In fact, a lot of the products they sell are actually cheaper than the bulk stuff you find at No Frills, with an obvious element of quality you may not find at bigger places. \n\nWanting to try out interesting varieties of stuff you already love, like lentils or rice or yes, even nuts? Nuthouse has got you covered. They carry a ton of different kinds, some of which you probably didn't even know existed. And that brings up one of the best things about buying in bulk in a place like this: you can buy in smaller amounts purely just because you want to try something. Buying in bulk doesn't have to be about being able to get more for less, it's about being able to also get, well, just less. The fact that Nuthouse just happens to make it also affordable is just the icing on the organic carrot cake.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0}

It's got a pleasant, relaxed vibe and people seemed to be rather enjoying themselves.\n\nOnce seated in our booth, we perused the menu and our lovely server explained how the restaurant works: you write down your order on the notepad provided, bring it up to the counter and hand it in. You can either pay right away or begin a tab. Any subsequent orders can be placed through the wait staff. I assume this method is effective for those in a hurry, but it did seem a little odd considering how often our server checked in on us. She also expounded upon the \"red sauce\" pizzas made with Campania tomato sauce, fior-de-latte mozzarella, basil and pecorino romano cheese. (The \"white sauce\"pizzas are made with a garlic and olive oil sauce instead of the tomatoes.)\n\nWe opted for the prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella balls for an appetizer, the funghi tartufo and San Andreas pizzas and, for dessert, the dolce and banana dish. As with any self-respecting pizza place, they had San Pellegrino on the menu so got an Aranciata (my fave) and a Limonata. My dining companion kindly took the order the counter while I scoped out the huge place before me. Famoso has really nice exposed brick walls, comfortable booths and, by my count, at least three staff members per table. There are a lot of eyes on tables and not much gets missed. The staff is universally nice, if perhaps inexperienced. It lacked a certain finesse, but made up for it in sweet charm.\n\nOur appetizer arrived and I'm glad we asked for salt, pepper and chili flakes. The mozzarella balls were tasty, but the red sauce (which would appear later on our funghi pizza) was very, very sweet. For my liking, too sweet.  A dash of salt and some chili flakes were necessary and helped considerably. I was hoping for crispier prosciutto, too; as a start to the meal, it was pretty average. If you're going to get an appetizer, I would recommend you try a salad. They looked fresh and tasty.\n\nOur funghi  tartufo pizza arrived fairly shortly afterward. It consisted of roasted white mushrooms, oyster mushrooms, truffle oil and parmiggiano reggiano.  Again, it was better with the salt and chili flakes.  The crusts at Famoso are a bit thicker than is the trend right now, but I liked the chewier texture. I only wish that this pizza had been left in the 900-degree oven a little longer as it needed a little more crispiness to counter the soft, melting cheese that was starting to soak through the crust. (A note: I took a slice of this one home and had it two days later. I have to say, it tasted much better as a leftover!)\n\nOur second pizza - the San Andreas - was a \"New World Pizza\" with a white sauce, chili-lime marinated chicken and fresh mozzarella. It was then baked and topped with avocado slices, diced roma tomatoes, onion, cilantro, a drizzle of cream and a lime wedge. Certainly not traditional, but pretty darned tasty. The pizza seemed to have stayed in the oven just that little bit longer and had that nice char on the bottom. The lime juice provided a bright flavour and the chicken was tender. (I'd have liked a little more chicken, but that's a bit of a nitpick. It was a good pizza.) Were I to go back, I would steer my companions toward it if they wanted to try something a little different.\n\nFinally, dessert. This was my favourite dish of the four we tried. A long, rectangular plate of roasted bananas coated in caramelized brown sugar, topped with pecans and caramel sauce and a scoop of ice cream in the middle arrived at the table and my eyes widened. This looked and smelled fantasti and tasted even better. The bananas were piping hot and creamy and contrasted beautifully with the crunch of the sugar and the chill of the ice cream. That dish was devoured in what had to be record time.\n\nOverall, Famoso is...fine. There isn`t anything in particular that stands out but there isn't anything egregiously wrong with it, either.  It caters to a wide variety of tastes so it is sure to be a good option if you are going out with a group with varying tastes or dietary restrictions or preferences. Do not bother with the prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella balls, but do not skip dessert.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0}

For such a moderately-priced Italian restaurant, they surely hold their own.\n\nI was ecstatic to find that my penne side dish with the Pollo alla Fiorentina - chicken sautéed with spinach and sun-dried tomatoes in smooth and rich cream sauce - could be replaced with tender gnocchi. I truly could eat pasta every day, but gnocchi is my new favourite indulgence. I'm on the hunt for the best in the city and will devour any potato pasta nugget that comes my way in the process.\n\nThe veal Marsala entree is adorned with tons of sautéed mushrooms, the vegetables were cut large and almost put the roasted potatoes to shame; it was true Italian comfort food.\nAnd as for the Papparedelle al Salmone, the wide threads of pasta are covered all over with a pink Salmon-infused cream sauce. Rich and smooth, this was definitely the star of our table.\n\nPersonally, I can't go to an Italian restaurant that has Tartufo on the menu and not order it - no matter how full dinner has left me. A few flavours are offered, but I finally landed on Tartufo Royale, a tart and sweet pairing of raspberry and chocolate ice creams covered in cocoa and drizzled with chocolate sauce. I also happened to snag a scoop of pistachio gelato, but it didn't hold a candle to the aforementioned chocolate indulgence.\n\nLa Passione was a nice surprise, with entrees coming in around $15-$20 and a wide-range of choices on the menu, it is sure to satisfy. They also occasionally post deals on Groupon - it makes for the perfect opportunity to get out and try something new.","useful":5,"funny":3,"cool":5}

Well no, it isn't, but that's exactly how I wanted to start this off. Man, I really wanted to love this place. La Revolucion just looks so dam cool, that I figured the whole experience was going to be amazing. When I was first drawn by the interesting front stained-glass window and poked my head inside to look around, I figured that in no-time-at-all, there'd be a lineup to get in. Sadly, I don't think that's going to be the case anytime soon.\n\nLa Revolucion is a Mexican restaurant, but at first glance, it certainly doesn't scream Mexican; after eating there, I'm not even sure that's what they're going for. It's a sparsely decorated joint that for some reason--at least while I was there--feels the need to distance themselves even more from their Mexican roots by blasting annoyingly loud rave music. I mean, their food is the typical, standard Mexican fare you'd expect, like enchiladas and tacos and burritos, but other than that and the few Mexican-esque decorations, there wasn't much Mexican about it at all.\n\nThey're heavily pushing the banditos aspect of Mexican culture, which is actually a pretty cool gimic in my eyes. While I get the whole concept of banditos and revolution, it seemed as though La Revolucion fell a little short of their delivery of the theme. While what little decor they have there is mostly bandito-related, the rest of the theme is left to interpretation. La Revolucion does feel as though they're finding their identity, but they have a lot of difficulty conveying what that identity is exactly to their guests. Sitting there, it doesn't feel as though you were part of the revolution, it feels as though you're interrupting them while they plan it, and they can't wait for you to leave so they can get back down to business.\n\nPresentation isn't their strong point either. They haphazardly slap the food down on the plate, without much concern for appearances. My enchiladas were slightly warm and covered in tasteless green salsa; my burrito was humungous, but it was bland and not nearly warm enough. When I asked for hot sauce, because it was nowhere to be found, I got a small ramekin with some sort of sauce, but it's details remained a mystery that was left for me to find out with no explanation from the server, and while you're waiting for that stuff to all arrive, there's no offer of chips and salsa or even water for that matter, which would have definitely improved the experience.\n\nInterestingly enough, before this place was a Mexican place it was, well, a Mexican place. Whoever it is that owns it probably just decided it was time to rebrand, and while that may have been a great idea on their part, the execution of their new brand and concept needs some polishing because it's hard to tell exactly what the concept is. La Revolucion may be a restaurant, but a revolution it is not.","useful":7,"funny":3,"cool":2}

Like most places owned and run by families, this restaurant is small, a bit cluttered with a mishmash of décor and, no matter the number of other patrons there at the time, has a staff that makes you feel like the centre of attention.\n\nThey happen to be closed on the weekend, but from Monday to Thursday they are open from 11:00 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. and Fridays from 11:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. The hours are slightly odd, but it makes for a great lunch spot, especially for those like me who tend to take lunch anytime between about noon and 3:00 p.m.\n\nThey offer a variety of chicken dishes, a number of different sides and even one vegetarian option. You can get a 1\/4 or 1\/2 rotisserie chicken dinner - white meat or dark meat - with a choice of two small sides for $6.50 - $10.00. For an additional $0.99 (small) or $1.98 (double) you can get a side of onion rings, Greek or Caesar salad.\n\nThe menu itself is pretty huge and is filled with quite a few options. The regular roster of sides, for example, includes Portuguese rice, roasted Parisian potatoes, steamed vegetables, French fries, garden salad or potato wedges. Mains include the abovementioned chicken combos, rib combos, a variety of salads and soups, chicken wings and fingers and sandwiches, like pulled chicken, grilled vegetable, grilled chicken, pork or sausage. They even offer catering.\n\nI decided upon the pulled chicken sandwich with a side of Parisian potatoes. The pulled chicken is topped with their \"famous\" hot sauce, served on a white or whole wheat Kaiser and is dressed with mayo, lettuce and tomato. All of this, with a drink, came in at about $9.\n\nOne of my all-time favourite side dishes are those lemony, roasted potatoes available at most Greek restaurants. Well, The Rotisserie House's Parisian roasted potatoes are a close second. They are red, probably from Paprika, and just a bit fiery from the restaurant's signature hot sauce. The pulled chicken sandwich was flavourful, tender and also had the same red hue from the sauce.\n\nI do enjoy spicy foods, though I am a bit of a wimp. This restaurant's hot sauce had a great kick and a good flavour, but it won't burn your mouth to the point that you can't taste anything else. This is really important, since they throw the hot sauce on their dishes, whether it's requested or not. Don't fret too much about all the spice if you're grabbing lunch and heading back to the office, you can buy a pack of gum here too!\n\nConsidering the size of this restaurant, I was quite surprised by the number of items they have on the menu. It was not overly busy when I walked in, so everything went very smoothly as far as timing and service went. The staff is extremely friendly, but very small, so I am curious to see what happens when it gets really busy. However, they seem to have it all figured out.\n\nIf I lived closer to Liberty Village, I could see this being a regular staple for me for a quick lunch, or to grab some dinner on the way home from work. The prices are reasonable, the food tastes good and it's quick and satisfying.","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":1}

With the exception of the Firkin on Runnymede, Dark Horse has one of the biggest and best outdoor spaces in the village to drink pints, people watch or eat burgers and fries.\n\nBut, as many people have pointed out before me, the service can range anywhere from slow to crappy when you're sitting out there. While you're waiting, you may even be waiting so long for service that you'll feel compelled to go inside and get your own drinks, which causes the server to give you attitude when she eventually gets to your table, which causes you to feel uncomfortable; you see the vicious circle taking shape here...\n\nAll-in-all, the food at Dark Horse isn't half bad. Granted, they aren't going to win any awards anytime soon, but for pub food that goes well with a few drinks, it's pretty decent. While some of the food, like the calamari and nachos, is previously frozen and highly unimaginative, other items, like their Village Burger or fish and chips, are clearly made in-house and truly tasty. They also serve a weekend brunch that is worth checking out, but expect to wait for a table; it fills up quickly with the neighbourhood locals.\n\nAll of the expected draft options are here...I think. Truth-be-told, the server never actually rattled off the draft list to us in the limited time she spent at our table. Luckily, there were a few beer-branded signs in the patio, which makes the process a little easier, but a lot less convenient.\n\nDark Horse's problems are easily fixable; they just need a bit more staff. Trust me, sit back on the patio, have a pint, and watch them work. It'll quickly become obvious that they're understaffed. Another server or two during their busier times, and Dark Horse could be fantastic.\n\nTruth be told, it's just a pub, and a fairly average one at that. If you're in a hurry, you may want to avoid this place, but if you've got some time to kill and want to soak up some sun on a patio, Dark Horse provides nicely.","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":0}

The dimly lit house-turned-restaurant with the splendidly seamy vibe immediately and completely tugged at my heart strings.  I loved the rickety setting and little details like the \"Draught: Use Your Eyes\" sign behind the bar.\n\nBut, as with any new love, first impressions can often deceive you; The Central played with my emotions.  The menu - and be warned the online menu is not what you will find when you arrive there - has so much potential and I very much wanted the food to live up to my expectations.  My party of three shared grilled calamari with side of salad greens in a light citrus dressing, followed by entrees of grilled mushroom salad with shrimp, a grilled vegetable sandwich with sweet potato fries, and a cheesesteak sandwich with Tom Yum soup, all of which (with three beers) came in at just over $60.\n\nThe menu items are not very risky, but still need to be done carefully to be successful.  As much as I wanted everything to come out perfectly, it simply did not.  First of all, the calamari was a very large serving - so far, so good.  But, in grilling it whole, the tips became overcooked and the centre remained undercooked, and there was a hint of burnt charcoal flavour.  The grilled vegetables were also overcooked, producing an all-over brown hue, making them completely lose their individuality.  The cheesesteak had the right flavour, but again, the beef was slightly overcooked and chewy.  Finally, after looking forward to trying one of the desserts in hopes for menu-redemption, like the candied strawberries or the ever-infamous deep fried Mars bars, we were told that all they had available was ice cream.  Not so impressive.\n\nWhile the main dishes and lack of desserts were disappointing, I do have to commend them on a couple of things.  All of the side dishes were on-point; the dressing on both the calamari dish, and the mushroom salad were light, flavourful and had a good citrus tang; the sweet potato fries were crispy, and came with a side of a creamy cinnamon dip that was a great alternative to regular ketchup; and the Tom Yum soup was hot, spicy, and a great choice for a chilly December night.\n\nI have decided that The Central could very well become a favourite spot of mine for drinks, and maybe appetizers, but is just not an ideal choice for a full dinner.  The venue itself is one that you should check out, and I expect it is only better when the patio is open in the summer.  If you don't want to sit in the main bar to listen to the band they have a cozy lounge space upstairs that can be rented for private parties.  Also, they clearly take pride in the beverage menu, especially the beer choices.  When we had some trouble deciding on a pint, we were offered a sample of a new label on tap called Netherworld, a Flying Monkey brew, which is similar to the popular Mill St. Tankhouse Ale.\n\nI give them an A+ for atmosphere, but only a gold star-for-effort on the menu.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1}

And Everest is certainly dressed to impress. The restaurant feels both sexy and modern, with dark mood lighting, clean lines, comfortable and cozy booth seating, and an eclectic playlist\/DJ, depending on what night you are in. With a great view of Queen West for people watching, and MuchMusic across the street, the atmosphere, music and style of the restaurant blend in perfectly with the locals.\n\nI was very excited to try a new place with an interesting food theme, something a little different from the usual weekend dinner and drinks, and hoping to find a new \"go-to\" place for a fun and creative meal. I secured reservations before our arrival, however, we were greeted with a bit of a frosty reception, waved to an area in the front of the room, and told I could sit wherever I wanted. Unorthodox, maybe, but sit we did!\nPutting the hostesses' indifference behind us, we decided to delve straight into the wine menu, and with a little help from our server, selected the Beringer Cabernet Sauvignon Knights Valley, a California vintage from 2009 for about $40. The wine was excellent, and I found the wine menu to be well priced for the quality of wines on the list.\n\nThe dinner menu ($15-$20) presents a somewhat more challenging predicament. Filled with Tibetan and Indian dishes, along side the same old North American stand-by of pasta and sandwiches, I found myself unsure if this was a Tibetan restaurant, or your average Italian eatery all dressed up. It's not that I mind an eclectic menu, in fact I appreciate one, however when venturing out to try a new type of cuisine (in this case, Tibetan), one wants to be sure that the restaurant is absolutely committed to their craft, and have their \"specialty cuisine\" down pat. Thus, I was unsure of whether venturing into the momas (Tibetan dumplings) and sha-momo (spinach and beef), or the fettuccine alfredo was the better option.\n\nAfter some quality deliberation between the Tibet\/North America paradox, I decided to try a platter, a mix of several different Tibetan style foods, to allow myself to experience as much of the cuisine as possible. The menu seemed heavy on potatoes, stewed meats and rice, so I decided to try almost all of the above. The stewed potatoes were good, cooked just right, but tasted much like something I could make at home, no real special spice or flavour that made me feel like I was trying something exotic. The rice was cooked with raisins, which just didn't do it for me, and was a little bland.  My meal was served with steamed Tibetan vegetables (broccoli and carrots), which aside from not seeming exceptionally Tibetan to me, were surprisingly good. An interesting side note, both of our meals were served with naan bread, which really was just pita bread from my estimation. Overall, I was fairly underwhelmed by my choice. My friend ordered the butter chicken on rice with naan bread (same problem), and said that she enjoyed her meal. The butter chicken looked and tasted pretty standard to me, so that must be a good thing, but neither of us could really wrap our heads around the lack on naan bread at restaurant serving Indian food. \n\nWhile I thoroughly enjoyed Everest restaurant for its attention to the design décor and ambience, I was definitely a little disappointed with my first foray into Tibetan food. I think the next time we decide to go out for Tibetan style cuisine, we will try \"Little Tibet\" further down Queen Street.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

It's a little cafe chock-full of character and a cool, homey-sorta vibe. You know the type of place I'm talking about: mismatched plates and cutlery on the tables, Value Village-esque paintings and pictures on the walls, slightly damaged panelling on the ceiling. It sorta looks like one day someone decided: 'Well, we have a stove. Why don't we open a restaurant?' It seems random, but truthfully, it doesn't matter all that much. If anything, those details make it better and much more comfortable.\n\nThere really isn't that much for food here. They've got a couple of items that are fairly easy for the lone person working to make when the place gets busy, which it definitely does. Mostly it's just the standard pressed sandwich kind of thing. No soup, no fries, no salad, as a side anyways. The friendly guy working there told me that it's not that kinda place. He said that it's mostly a cafe and a place to drink booze.\n\nThe menu is up on a chalkboard, and like I mentioned, it mostly has pressed sandwiches, like grilled cheese with apples and Tandoori chicken stuffed Naan bread. The sandwiches certainly aren't bad, but sadly, the majority of the stuff they make seems to have been brought in with little of it made in-house, like the Naan bread. The Naan was the kinda stuff pressed and packaged somewhere distant, and then bought at some grocery retail giant. It definitely would have been better if they worked with someone local to get some truly authentic stuff. They do have quite a few baked goods too. I'm not sure if those were made in-house or not, but they look nice next to a cup of the great coffee they serve.\n\nI've seen some pictures of brunch items at Holy Oak, like eggs Benny, but based on when I was there I couldn't see that happening. Maybe they do bring someone in on the weekends to cook, but they guy working never mentioned it to me when I asked him about the food or the limited menu.\n\nI went during the week for lunch, and this little place was pretty packed. Mostly with twenty and thirty somethings in front of laptops. It seems like a pretty cool place to work for those of us that frequent coffee shops for that sorta thing, because there really isn't much else in the neighborhood that offers it. It's cozy and comfortable, and I could easily see myself sitting there with a coffee, comfortably typing away.\n\nHoly Cafe is a neat place, but it certainly doesn't warrant a big trip to get to it. If you happen to be in the neighborhood and you're looking for a comfortable place to soak up WiFi and get a decent cup of coffee, Holy Oak can definitely provide.

I mean, I know the restaurant options in Bloor West Village are limited, but I really have no idea how that place hung on for as long as it did. With horrible service, brutal food, and staff that spent more time admiring themselves in the mirror than their customers, they created a place that was meant to be avoided. Yet somehow, it managed to exist on that corner for years.\n\nSo, imagine my surprise when I saw the beautiful sight of a building permit and brown construction paper covering their windows one day...\n\nA few months later, The Kennedy Public House was born. And boy-oh-boy, this place is exactly what  BWV needs. BWV is virtually void of restaurants serving great food. Ok, so there's earth and Dr. Generosity, but other than that, your choices are pretty limited compared to the tons of options available to other Toronto neighbourhoods. That's why seeing something as untraditional in BWV as The Kennedy is such a welcoming sight.\n\nThe Kennedy has a cool vibe that, if you know the neighbourhood, you wouldn't expect to see there. It seems oddly out-of-place while at the same time seems oddly comfortable being there. With a laboriously nice interior space, the entire design is well-thought out a nice to be in. But surprisingly, The Kennedy isn't just nice to look at; it also has exceptionally good food.\n\nThe Kennedy's menu doesn't serve your typical pub grub; it's much more imaginative than that. Non-traditional items, like polenta burgers, calamari po'boy sandwiches, and pork belly casoulet easily compliment more traditional pub fare, like wings, macaroni and cheese, and thin crust pizzas. Their menu does a fantastic job of covering everyone while still remaining concise and well-thought out.\nWorking with a number of local businesses, the Kennedy also proudly sources bread and meats from places you're probably familiar with, like Cobs bread and Wellington County Beef. Nice. I've always found that knowing where the food comes from somehow makes it taste better.\n\nOne other thing worth mentioning: The Kennedy has unisex bathrooms. And they've incorporated them into the place really nicely, except for the hand-dryer. The bathroom hand-dryer must be the loudest dam one in the entire free-world. If you happen to be sitting in the back-half of the restaurant, it might even ruin your experience. Hopefully they'll turn to either cloth or paper towels, or they'll just find one that is quieter.\n\nKeep in mind though, if you're looking for a relaxing experience, this isn't the place. With strollers and screaming babies during the day that makes it resemble a Montesorri school, and lineups and loud music in the evening that makes it resemble something at John and Adelaide, The Kennedy doesn't provide a quite and relaxing experience; what they do provide is a killer take on the food you wouldn't expect to find in a typical public house.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1}

An easy walk from the Rosedale subway stop, we went the evening of the Stanley Cup final, expecting the place to be packed, but managed to find comfortable high-top seating, and friendly service, amidst a fairly busy night.\n\nThe Rebel House is a small pub, with a quaint upstairs section, where we sat. Several TV's aired the hockey game, and there was an eclectic mix of people, some older, into their 50's, but predominantly a mix of twenty and thirtysomething young professionals and students.\n\nThe menu is varied, but small, although they offer a revolving door of several daily specials that seem to be based on season and availability, which is always a good bet.\n\nMy dining partner decided to go with the daily special Mussels ($14), absolutely delicious in a white wine and garlic sauce, with toasted garlic bread. I ordered the Spicy Spinach Cheese Pennies ($10), small appetizer-sized cheese patties, with nary a spinach leaf in sight...nor were they spicey. No matter. These delightful little morsels were crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside, and came with a delectable tomato chutney and sour cream to top with. At our server's suggestions, I also ordered the Spinach and Apple Salad ($6), with cheddar cheese, toasted almonds, and a homemade maple dressing on the side. A wonderful combination. In fact, we liked the cheese pennies so much, we ordered another batch, only to find that that a repeat order isn't always as good the second time around. These pennies were so thick with grease, I found myself soaking up the oil slick with a napkin just to get them down. I think ordering a third time might have settled this dilemma for good, but for now I choose to remember the experience based on my initial encounter with the Spicy Spinach Cheese Pennies; delightful.\n\nMy dining partner, an \"adventurous\" drinker himself, ordered a Labatt Blue, but it did come in the extra large bottle, which made him smile from ear to ear. I ordered the Henry of Pelham Pinot Noir to start, but must admit that it tasted watered down and a bit weak. Not to be discouraged, I tried the 2006 Cabernet Franc Special Reserve VQA after dinner, and was pleasantly surprised by one of the nicer glasses of wine I have had at a pub in some time. It had a heavy quality, with a nice vanilla finish. I would go back to Rebel House just to try this glass of wine again.\n\nOur server was friendly and talkative, and the prices at Rebel House are fairly reasonable. Wine was about $7-$8 a glass, and our meals were between $8-$12 for the appetizers, and up to $20 for an entrée. Except for the bad experience with the second order of cheese pennies, Rebel House is an excellent neighbourhood pub, serving up good food at good prices.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

In a desperate attempt to finally darken the doorway of Hey Lucy, I was disheartened to find that going right after work is not nearly early enough to snag a table for cheap martini Wednesday at that popular King West spot. Enter stage-right, Ultimate Café (a bit of Entertainment District fun for you there). Whether coincidentally or strategically, they also offer their own cheap martini Wednesday - how clever. \n\nTheir menu is fairly standard, including soups, nachos, sandwiches and Paninis, pastas and salads and they say the ingredients are bought fresh daily from Kensington Market.\n\nAfter my first meal, I decided to do some reading and collect the thoughts from others before making my final decision on Ultimate. The reviews are mixed, and I have to agree with that sentiment.\n\nI've now been to Ultimate twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. The night of the martinis, I decided to make a meal of appetizers - a favourite thing to do. I had the spring rolls and the sweet potato and lemongrass soup. I wasn't disappointed in the least; the spring rolls were crunchy and hot and the soup, though a tad too sweet for my own taste (always a risk for sweet potato dishes), was flavourful, thick and rich. It was a satisfying meal but, much like the menu, was basic stuff.\n\nThen, I went back for lunch. \n\nWe started with the nachos which turned out to be a delight. They look completely unimpressive, but once you dive in you'll realize that there is just the right amount of melted cheese, neither scorched or soggy, and it's topped lightly with chopped lettuce, tomato, olives and jalapeno. I have come across some online grumbles about the portion sizes, but any more and it would have proven far too big for a two-person starter or a one-person meal. My entrée was the Montreal smoked meat Panini with a side salad. The Panini was my favourite dish there by far. The meat was warm and tender and, again, was not over-sized. The sandwich was obviously freshly pressed and there was a tangy mustard spread topping it off. But, here's the rub - the salad was small and the leaves were wilted, which is a common complaint across the boards about their greens and the dressing could not possibly have been made in-house. It maybe could have passed for garnish. A really top-notch side could have elevated this dish to be lunch-time excellence. Like the portions, the prices are decent, with both of my visits coming in at just around $20 per person\n\nThere is one very short footnote-type comment that I must leave you with. On both occasions I was greeted by an employee whom I can only assume is the host. He will nab you on the street when you stop to glance at the menu to convince you to come in and, though he means well, will be extremely present during your time there. I can't say it was bothersome enough to warrant a phone call, but I also cannot give you my recommendation without mentioning this very obvious addition to the dining experience at Ultimate. \n\nSo, I toyed with a 2-star vs. my decided upon 3-star rating. The decor is kind of cool, the service was fast and courteous, despite the over-attentive host and we were seated in no time on a busy night. They offer some pretty good, if not somewhat lack-lustre grub, with at least one amazing sandwich. \n\nJust doors down from the previously reviewed Joe Mamas, King West is turning out to be a favourite food stop for me.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0}

Kent is just one of a series of 'Duke Pubs' scattered around Toronto, and judging from the fairly comprehensive website, each has a slightly different décor, but all of them seem to tap into that English corner pub ambience.\n\nAfter a long week at work, I was on the hunt for a casual space to grab a pint, enjoy some hearty food, and catch up with some friends; the Duke of Kent was a great choice...for the most part.\n\nI snagged a corner booth with my dinner group on a busy Friday night.  When we first walked in, it seemed hopeless. We wanted dinner, but there was nary a table to be seen.  The staff did everything they could to make a space for us so we weren't forced back out into the cold to one of the other countless restaurants in the area.  That is what service is all about, and we were happy to stay.  Many thanks to the serving staff for being so accommodating on a hopping Friday night!\n\nAs for the food, it is the expected and welcomed pub spread.  They offer up fish & chips (yes, served in a basket on paper), pot roast and potatoes with buttered peas, and even bangers and mash.  You will find an array of reasonably priced English pub food on the menu, with entrees coming in at about $12 across the board.\n\nAs I've said before, I tend to go for the specials, and that night it was Moroccan Stew.  Unfortunately, I am sad to say it was disappointing.  The dish was somewhere between a curry and a Mexican chili, and I was given a healthy serving for the $12.99 price-point.  But, I couldn't help but become envious of those around me who had gravy-topped pot pies, crispy fish and chips, beefy burgers and gooey quesadillas.  I probably would not have been as put-off by the it if it was labelled on the menu, as it was on my bill - just 'vegetable stew'.  It was not as exotic as the name lead me to believe, and with a delicious-looking curry dish on the main menu, I expected more spice and life in my 'Moroccan' Stew special.\n\nFor a visit to the Duke, I suggest going full-English.  I saw enough plates of fish and chips go by to convince me that it is a popular item, and how much more traditional can you get than that?  Also, I have the 'famous' deep-fried pepperoni targeted - it has to be famous for a reason!\n\nAt the end of it all, the Duke of Kent draws in a wonderfully lively crowd, and provides a great atmosphere and service, albeit a bit slow - but hey, it was busy!  My food may have only been so-so, but the brew was cold, and my night was great.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":2}

The entrance way is virtually non-existent, and stepping through the front door immediately plunges you into the middle of the usually busy and oddly laid out dining room. At the back, a long wooden bar--the type you'd feel comfortable seeing in a Boston Pizza--eclipses the view entirely. The bar is far too big, and completely takes away from the Indian experience, and the only décor to be found is some dated Indian travel posters and a few paintings themed of elephants and palm trees. But trust me, it doesn't matter in the slightest. You likely won't even notice. Why? Because this place churns out some seriously outstanding Indian food that would be just as good if it was served on a picnic table in the neighbouring Christie Pits Park.\n\nSavoury and creamy butter chicken, seasoned and spiced chicken masala, bright and soft saffron rice; all of the items you'd expect to see on an Indian menu are here. I've been here a few times, and my opinion is that the best way to order is to share, especially if your experience with Indian food is limited. Ordering a few samosas (meat patties) and cauliflower pakoras (chickpea battered cauliflower), and some peas pulao (flavoured basmati rice), a bowl of chicken masala (chicken with yogourt and spices), a bowl of fish curry (masala spiced-salmon) and a plate of naan bread (Tandoori-fried bread) for example, allows you to try a lot of different things, and can be more than enough to accommodate upwards of 6 people.\n\nNow, I don't want to just casually mention the naan bread like that. I'd be doing it a profound injustice. It is absolutely to-die-for beyond good. It is never made ahead of time; it's made right when you order it. It's soft, cooked perfectly, and has a slight charcoal flavour from being expertly cooked in the tandoor. I've stopped in before just to pick up a few pieces of naan and nothing else. If you're there, definitely order it.\n\nPleasantly enough, this place is never at a loss for staff. Any evening you decide to go, you're sure to be taken care of. One of the things--and I cant believe I'm saying this--is that this place may actually be overstaffed. I've gone there before and felt as if I may have been the server's only table, despite being a packed house. It's a true joy to experience.\n\nI know I said that the ugly bar and awkward entrance-way don't matter, and they don't for me. But if you're after more than just amazing Indian food, like say, an authentic setting and traditionally dressed staff, then you may want to keep looking; you won't find that here. What you will find is skillfully cooked, delicious food served to you by exceptionally attentive, friendly staff.","useful":8,"funny":1,"cool":2}

It might be a little too unassuming for its own good, as many people seemed to question its whereabouts when I mentioned its name...but maybe Bar Salumi doesn't like the spotlight.  Indeed, its sign is almost an afterthought, with the store's original signage for an antique shop, dominating the storefront.\n\nMy friend and I had been meaning to go ever since she discovered they served Burrata pizza.  She really has a thing for that cheese, and I can't say I blame her. It's delicious.  We went awhile back, excited at the prospect of this new twist on a Margharita pie, only to find out the chef was on vacation and they were only serving up the liquid portion of their menu.  Normally I wouldn't have a problem with this, and in some cases I would actually prefer it, but that night we were hungry and consequently, deflated. My friend entered the chefs ETA in her phone, and we vowed to return.\n\nTwo weeks later, the alarm sounded, reminding us that the chef was back to work (and also that she had golden potatoes ready to harvest in Smurf Village).  We went the very next day.\n\nAs it was on our previous visit, Bar Salumi was quiet and dark, illuminated by flickering chandeliers (leftovers from the former antique shop maybe?) and tea light candles housed within mason jars.  Hanging legs of prosciutto fight for space with ceiling fans, and a boar's head watches diners from high above on the back wall.  I know it might not sound like it (what with the strong presence of dangling cured meat and taxidermy) but it has a real romantic vibe happening.\n\nThere is no kitchen at Bar Salumi, so our personable apron-clad server was also our chef.  The menu is a small one, focused on pizza and apps, so diners can watch as everything is prepared behind the bar. It did get a bit hot, what with the pizza oven operating from within the same room, but think how cozy that would be on a winter's night.\n\nThe menu is presented on the wall in cafeteria style (or bowling alley) fashion, with those little plastic letters that slide in and out, and I half expected to see nachos and cheese listed somewhere.  More menus were brought to us on mini clipboards, and because the food menu was unnecessary as we had fully rehearsed our order, we paused awhile over the drink list.  They offer a thoughtful selection of reds and whites as well as some interesting cocktails.  We went with two glasses of Malbec ($12 each) to go with our starter of olives & nodini with ricotta salata ($4).  So far so good, except that I couldn't help but think the nodini crackers weren't the most functional choice for the cheese...more like basketball hoops for the olives.\n\nOur pizza ($14), although not wood-fired, did come served on a cross-section of a tree trunk.  With the creamy white Burrata blending with the red of the San Marzano tomatoes, punctuated by basil it was like an homage to the Italian flag.  I wish I could say that the Burrata we were so looking forward to, made it the penultimate Margharita experience, but it was like any other made with Bufala.  The two are from the same family after all, so I'm not sure what we were thinking.  Cheese does things to people.  That being said however, we weren't disappointed, as the sauce was tangy, the crust was crispy, and it was big enough for both of us to eat and still take home leftovers.\n\nI wouldn't rank the pizza with the likes of pie giants, Terroni or Libretto, but Bar Salumi is rife with ambience where the aforementioned aren't.  The promise of Buratta may have lured me in the first time, but it's the character that will bring me back.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1}

Walking into Hey Meatball! instantly feels like you are walking into your old high school cafeteria. A few two and four person tables are set up, and there's one long 16 person table down the middle, all this in a space that was clearly not built for this many diners. I wasn't entirely sure if we were to seat ourselves or wait for direction. We inquired with the cashier\/order taker\/owner to find out. I know he was the owner because he told us.\n\nFor a restaurant that serves all meatballs, all the time, we were surprised to find that there were only three entrée selections on the chalk board and a few side dishes to choose from. Of the four side dishes, two had already been crossed out for the day, leaving a side salad or butternut squash soup. I decided to order the vegetarian eggplant 'meatballs' with polenta and parmesan, and my dining partner ordered the Porky  meatballs, (a combination of pork and ground beef) with tomato sauce on spaghetti. Immediately I was told that they were out of polenta and was asked \"what would I like it on?\" Unsure of my options, even after asking, I replied with \"spaghetti,\" as that was the only thing on the chalkboard that I was sure that they had in stock.\n\nWe each ordered a homemade cream soda, we were given a number, and we took a seat. Our number was called out about 10 minutes later, and we immediately noticed the disparity in portion size. My eggplant 'meatballs' were served on a huge swirl of very al dente spaghetti, whereas the porky meatballs arrived on what could be considered an order from the children's menu- if there was one that is.\n\nThe food was good, but not great. The eggplant 'meatballs' had a nice consistency, and were spicy and full of flavor. The tomato sauce that the dish was served with was hearty and not too salty, however I thought that the pasta could have been cooked a little more. The Porky meatballs were excellent, the combination of pork and beef proved to be a hit, however we both found that the tomato sauce served with the meatballs was far too sweet for the savory nature of the dish.\n\nThe saving grace of the meal was the amazing cream sodas they make fresh on site. They were a throwback to the Jones cream soda that you used to drink as a kid, but without too much fizz. Unfortunately, when the beverage you order to go with your meal is the best part of the experience, you know that there is something missing.\n\nHey Meatball! is missing the warm and friendly atmosphere you would expect to find in a restaurant with a wide open kitchen, communal tables and a chef that endeavors to use ingredients within a 100-mile radius of Toronto. All great qualities to have in a unique restaurant with a unique concept, but here, it just didn't seem to create anything memorable. There was no music playing while we were in, and the gruff reception and fluorescent lighting that made it a little harsh on the eyes made Hey Meatball! mostly a letdown.","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":2}

Craft beers, slightly pretentious menu and crowd, its Junction location (sigh, I remember the days when they avoided this area). And although I spend quite a bit of time in the neighbourhood, I only managed to getting around to checking it out a few days ago. That's mostly because it's a difficult place to notice, with an unassuming, simple '3030 stenciled on the front door, and not much else to identify it.\n\n3030 is huge inside... seriously huge; especially for a place in The Junction. Stuffed full of small table settings and 2 full bars, it seems more like you're in a concert hall than a neighbourhood restaurant, and that's with good intention. 3030 is built to be a live music venue that doubles as a food-venue, and in my opinion, not the other way around (although that's what they go for in the off hours).\n\nOne thing's for sure, they put a lot of thought into their draft selection. The back bar has taps full of local-ish craft brews, including Wellington, Beaus, and even some other, more difficult one's to find, like the Junction Craft Brewing's IPA (which was fantastic), a Sawdust City stout, and a Broadhead White. Clearly, they take their beer selection very seriously. The unfortunate thing about the bars though is that with no stools to sit on, you get the distinct that they don't want you hanging out there.\n\nMuch like you'd expect from a place aimed at young-pros in The Junction (sigh), the atmosphere sets it up as a pretty cool place to hang out, with shelves full of board games and walls lined with old-school pinball machines and plenty of interesting art. With the retro pinball machines all lit up in the evening, it gives the perfect backdrop to a night out.\n\nBut with just a little '5 dollar snack menu' card on each table, you wonder what about those of us that were there for more than snacks. Our server haphazardly and unconfidently rattled off the items they serve (there was only 4 of them at the time) but not before having to go back to the kitchen a couple of times before she could get it right. I asked if the items changed daily, hence no menus and the difficulty remembering them, but nope, these items had been here for a while she said. While it's cool to try items out to see what works, I hope that eventually they'll put together a more permanent and more expansive menu, or at least one that changes seasonally.\n\nBecause none of their mains sounded appealing to us, we instead opted for the items on the snack menu. The Butter Chicken Wings, while mostly tasty with the typical strong flavours you'd expect, arrived lukewarm. The Potato Wedges on the other hand, were indescribably and inedibly  hot, which turned out to be ok because they were bland and tasteless anyways. Overall, we just didn't find any of the items on the snack menu impressive at all.\n\nIf you're in the neighbourhood, 3030 may be worth checking out, but I'd say solely for their draft selection; and although the fact that there isn't much like it in the neighbourhood makes it the kind of place you want to check out, I'd wait until there is a concert or show you want to see before making the trek. In my opinion, it just isn't worth going out of your way for.\n\nWith a Gabby's now opened next door, I remember feeling a little upset for them having competition so close from some evil, corporate chain, but really, it's of little consequence. It's obvious right away that they'll both be attracting very different types of people.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1}

In fact, Buster's Sea Cove isn't even in the same boat. At Buster's, you won't find soft lighting, romantic ambience, or table-side service, but what you're pretty much guaranteed to find, is some killer seafood served up really, really quickly.\n\nFresh-made fish and chips are the staple in this place, but they've got so much more than that. Their huge menu has everything from crab cakes and clam strips to fried oysters and fish-topped salads. And their fish-type sandwiches, something that they happen to do really, really well, are outstanding. I'm not talking about your standard old fried-fish-on-a-bun here; Buster's rivals the best seafood takeout places with crab cake paninis and seared tuna melts sandwiches.\n\nBut don't overlook the fish and chips either. This little takeout stand easily delivers one of the best plates of the stuff in the city. They've got a few varieties of fish to choose from, and each of them is served up expertly battered and crispy. Each plate of fish and chips also comes with in-house made fries and a killer slaw.\n\nBuster's also has a few other options you wouldn't expect from a takeout stand. Grilled swordfish, seafood bisque, rainbow trout, even octopus to name a few. It ain't fine dining by any means, but they truly do push the limits of what takeout is both in quality and selection.\n\nChances are though, once you get your food you'll be spending most of your time searching for a place to eat it. Busters only has 4 tables or so scattered around in front of the counter, but if those are full-and they probably will be-you're on your own. There's an exit close by to the Market's back patio and parking lot where most of Buster's customers end up, but trust me, if it's a nice day out, that'll fill up pretty quick too and you'll be left looking for a place to eat your by-then-getting-cold food.\n\nTruth be told though, even if you're standing out back of the market among parked cars and alleyways, it won't matter all that much. You might not even notice. Whether it's a crab cake sandwich or plate of fish and chips, the food at Buster's is just that dam good.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1}

You can walk in to place your order or call ahead for pick up or delivery; they add a reasonable $3.00 delivery charge for the area nearby and $5.00 + for further surrounding areas, depending on the distance. If you call with special requests or large party orders, the chefs will accommodate you in a very timely manner - if it's not on the menu, just ask!\n\nJust like the fish, the interior is raw. There is actually one very small table with some chairs around it by the front window, but I've never seen anyone sitting there. There's a display that sits just to the left when you walk in, covered with bags of Japanese snacks for purchase and, on your right, you'll find shelves filled with a few groceries; dried sheets of nori is one recognizable item that jumps out immediately.\n\nChef John Lee has been serving up fresh and beautiful sushi platters at this location since 2005. It is impressive to note that he worked under the iron chef himself, Morimoto. There is something soothing about the fact that they prepare your food behind the counter in full view. It's that commitment to preparing and presenting the freshest ingredients that has built their dedicated customer base.\n\nLunch combos range from $15 to $25 and dinner combos from $15 to $35. If you choose the sashimi - individual pieces of raw fish with no rice - it does bring the price up a bit, but it's well worth it for something so delectable. If ordering a la carte is more your style, there are unique rolls to choose from, including: nigiri sushi (fish on rice), small rolls, inside out rolls and special rolls with everything from eel to sea urchin to marinated dried pumpkin.\n\nOur dinner for two was easily fulfilled with the vegetable sushi combo, which includes miso soup, and adding one Una Tekkyu roll (eel, tuna, cucumber, fish roe) and, my sushi must, an order of edamame. The vegetable rolls are prepped delicately to appear as if they too are made with tender slices of fish, the cucumber rolls are a refreshing addition and there is even a roll with an orange, crunchy vegetable called Burdock - carrot-like in appearance and texture, but with a different and unique flavour.\n\nTheir fresh ingredients are really the highlight. Nori can easily become chewy and tough, but Marche's is tender and graces the palate without even a hint of the unappealing sea-scent that you might get from a lesser sushi establishment. I have to say I'm not the biggest fan of the cold edamame they serve, but I wouldn't want to trek my raw fish home with something steaming hot resting on top of it anyway, so I don't mind this one pre-prepared item.\n\nIf your only sushi experience is picking up a pack of that generic grocery store stuff, with the fake green grass insert, Sushi Marche is really the place to discover all the glory of raw fish.","useful":4,"funny":2,"cool":1}

Weekends however, draw a big crowd and my nine-to-five job prevented me from going during the week and avoiding said crowd.  Fortunately, having resigned from my job to be a writer (see: unemployed) I am now afforded the luxury of going to brunch on say, a Tuesday...which is exactly what I did this week.\n\nI love Mitzi's location.  Tucked away on a quiet corner of Sorauren, surrounded by century homes, purple and yellow painted Mitzi's is a bit out-of-place, but that's the appeal.  I have a thing for old neighbourhood general stores, and that's what Mitzi's reminds me of.  Inside looked exactly how I both expected and hoped for; arborite tables with mismatched chairs, a glass display case that housed trays of muffins at the time, and walls adorned with local art.  I really, really wanted to like this place.\n\nAnd like it I did, however my friend was less than satisfied with her experience.  Let's start with mine shall we?  Mitzi's has a small but thoughtful menu, and I had previously perused it online, so I knew exactly what I wanted.  Craving sweet over savoury, I ordered the French toast as planned ($10.95).  Made with Challah bread it is then topped with a peach & ginger compote, covered in graham cracker crumbs and generously doused with real maple syrup (the last step done by yours truly).  It was fantastic.  The bread was thick and fluffy, and the compote had just the right amount of ginger in it.  It had all the makings of a dessert...in a breakfast.  It should be noted that this dish is typically served with whipped cream, but I decided it was too much of an indulgence (says the person who used so much syrup as to make her French toast wish it had signed up for swimming lessons).\n\nSitting just adjacent to the expanding pool of syrup, but not completely out of its reach, were the home fries, which offset the sweetness of the French toast nicely.  Made with halved baby potatoes they were spiced perfectly.  My only complaint is that there weren't more of them, but it's probably for the best in the long run.  If the toast itself was the star of the show, then the home fries were the understudy.\n\nAs I had already had my morning coffee I chased all of this with a glass of their homemade orange\/banana\/mango juice.  It was just thick enough to know it was the real thing, and at $3 I think it was good value.\n\nThe glowing endorsement ends with my friends order.  She was so looking forward to her poached eggs (also $10.95).  Served on Portuguese cornbread, topped with wilted spinach,  and slathered in roasted red pepper & asiago sauce, it looked delicious when set down in front of her, but as she cut into the egg with her fork, the yolk failed to flow.  Her poached eggs weren't poached at all... they were hard-boiled.  Cue the violins. Tasty yes, but it wasn't what she wanted, and the accompanying rye bread would fail to serve its dipping duty.\n\nThis would have been a 4 star review had I made it a solo trip, but alas the poached eggs (or lack thereof) knocked it down a peg.  Mitzi's is still worth a visit though for the French toast (and I hear the Oatmeal Buttermilk Pancakes are pretty killer too), but if it's poached eggs you crave, be specific,...if only for the sake of your toast and its reason for being.","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":1}

The bread itself was warm and chewy with a pretzel like flavour.  It came with an olive, rosemary and thyme tapenade that was rich and salty.  I tried to stop after one slice, but failed miserably.  I managed to leave one out of the four slices on the plate but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't staring at it longingly throughout dinner.\n\nNext, came my Beet Caprese Salad ($13).

The combination of flavours and textures worked well together, and it was just a very fresh salad overall. If seasons were characterized by salads this one would be spring.  It was filling enough to be my main course, but I wasn't done yet.\n\nAs full of bread and beets as I was, I couldn't wait for my cavatelli ($13).  Hand rolled and made with semolina it had a texture similar to gnocchi but it wasn't as filling.  The sauce was reminiscent of my grandmothers, and that's a compliment as although she wasn't Italian, she was married to one and had learned a thing or two over the years.\n\nI had initially sent away the wine menu, although I'm not sure why exactly.  Maybe it was an unexpected burst of responsibility on my part as it was a weekday afternoon and I had another review to do...but those are hardly excuses not to partake.  It's part of the job after all.  Either way, one of the resident sommeliers saw right through me and insisted on returning the wine menu to my table.  Smart man.\n\nPaese has an extensive wine list and while most can only be purchased by the bottle, they do have a comprehensive list that is sold by the glass.  Now I'm no expert on wine, but I do drink a lot of the stuff so I know what I like, and I like Amarone.  I was given a sample of a 2004 Fumanelli Amarone before committing to a full glass, after which I gave the go ahead for my server to fill 'er up.  Rich and full-bodied it was a great complement to my meal, but as far as I'm concerned it would be a great complement to anything...cheese, pasta, breakfast...\n\nBecause of its location, I probably won't make a repeat visit but I don't think Paese is having a hard time attracting other customers.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good and affordable meal with some vino before or after catching a show.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Pachuco opened its doors on Friday, January 13th, perhaps a sign of bad luck, but that shouldn't hinder their success.\n\nPachuco is a small (read: reservations) and cozy space, with exposed brick walls, wrought-iron décor and, and a pretty impressive wall of wine bottles lit by a neon sign. Even though Pachuco shares a kitchen with older brother and Danforth favourite  Embrujo Flamenco, they definitely serve up their own distinctive flavour.\nTheir menu is well thought out and varied, with an excellent selection of meat, fish and vegetarian dishes. Their appetizer menu alone is worth the trip. With a confident boasting of guacamole flavours, including goat cheese, blue cheese, smoked trout and walnut, and a guacamole sampler patter that allows you to try three of their creations, there is seemingly no end to the interesting flavour combinations. We decided to stick to our guns, however, and go with the traditional guacamole, which was a stellar choice; lots of lime, onion and creamy avocado, but with no flavour left too overpowering. Their homemade tortilla chips have to be mentioned as well: crisp and tasty. I am hoping they will one day provide these in a to-go bag for purchase before you leave. We also ordered the Chile poblana, swathed in an excellent and perfectly spicy tomato sauce, with queso fresco and refried beans, all baked perfectly. The portion size on both entrees was more than enough for two people, and it could easily serve as a great entrée.\n\nFor our meals (both $15) we went with the Taquitos de Machaca (coffee and ancho braised beef brisket, with guacamole and honey chipotle salsa), and the pre-Hispanic delicacy of Taquitos de Huitlacoche (corn truffle, onions, jalapeño peppers, Cazuela beans served with requesón-avocado salsa). Where to start? Let's save the most interesting for last. The braised beef was well cooked and well spiced, the chipotle salsa was a great added touch, and one order of beans and rice between the two of us was more than enough to share. In fact, we both left incredibly full. Their fresh-this-second corn tortillas are amazing, sweet, soft and still warm from the press, prepared just the way you would expect to find them in a traditional Mexican eatery. The Huitlacoche, however, was an adventure in and of itself. \n\nFor those who don't know (myself included), Huitlacoche is a fungus, which grows naturally on corn in damp environments. The fungus is harvested and has been consumed as a delicacy for centuries in Central and South America cuisine. When it arrived, it tasted smokey and earthy; it looked like a dark mash of black corn, onion- and was that a jalapeño in there? Hard to tell. The dish was good, but I can't say I would strongly recommend it. Overall, I found the food at Pachuco's to be mostly over-salted, and the Huitlacoche had to be the worst offender. This is the main reason why I would not order it again; although the flavour was very different from any other Mexican dishes I have tried, and I actually did enjoy it, I just could not get over the intensity of the salt. \n\nThe drinks and food at Pachuco's ranged from good to very good, and if they could tone down the salt (margaritas included), I would probably rate most of it as excellent. However, I cannot say our overall experience was excellent, but I would not fault them for it in my overall rating. Being that it was their opening weekend, one expects a few hiccups, and I am sure they will be cleared up by the time you visit. I was served the wrong meal at first, and we had to wait about 10 to 15 minutes for the Huitlacoche to be prepared, instead of the fish tacos, (though delightful looking), I was initially served. By the time my dish came around, the other half of our meal was cold. Our side plates and used cutlery were never removed from our table after we finished with our appetizers, and the tables are so small and cramped as it is, there was no room for our mains. Instead of removing our side plates, there was a vain attempt to stuff everything on the table. I eventually had to ask for fresh cutlery and removal of the used dishes from our table. Not once, but twice, we almost had our not-quite-finished drinks taken from us, and we had to ask a few times for extra tortillas. It seemed a little strange to me that you would only get four at a time, and as great as they were, they are very, very small, so I imagine each meal would require a minimum of 3 or 4 on its own. \n\nOverall, I think these are minor complaints, especially since it was Pachuco's opening preview. I found that the service was friendly and genuine, the restaurant was quaint and ambient, with Latin music, candles and a few kitschy décor details, which made it seem authentic and allow it to live up to it's self-proclaimed 'Modern Mexican' dining experience.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":1}

I actually went out of my way to go to this place one day when I was craving some good-ole-fashioned-BBQ. Claiming to be serving it up in true Southern-style, I thought that there's no way this could go wrong. I've actually been to Texas and all throughout the Southern states on a fairly serious eating vacation, and lemme tell you something, The Drake and their lil' BBQ place owe the great state of Texas and its surrounding neighbours a serious apology...\n\nDrake BBQ has a slew of great reviews all over the Internet. Everyone on Yelp, Twitter, and a bunch of TO food mags have been raving about the authentic, bad-ass Texas and Carolina style BBQ they've had in this place. I've read so many good comments, that I figured I must have gone to the wrong place. Maybe, I thought, there was some other place that just happens to look exactly the same, on the exact same street, with the exact same type of food?\n\nNope... I was in the right place. It just sucked is all.\n\nBecause they have such a loyal following, I'm sure quite a few people are going to dislike what I'm saying here, but in all honesty, if you got served what I did, you'd be disappointed too. My Carolina pulled-pork sandwich was small, dry, and amazingly enough, was completey void of BBQ sauce, which is a fairly important staple in a pulled-pork sandwich. They must have had some BBQ sauce somewhere in there, but if they did, they didn't offer it to me, and it certainly wasn't on my sandwich. My coleslaw was even worse. It was incredibly bland and wasn't much more than shredded cabbage with a slight trace of what I assume was salad dressing. Not to mention that this stuff was expensive! Two of those sandwiches and an itty-bitty coleslaw-plus tip of course-cost over 20 bucks.\n\nWelcome to The Drake BBQ; it's BBQ with a side of pretentiousness. You don't like it? Trust me. If it's the same guy working behind the counter when I was there, then he won't care at all. I asked if we could get some fries with our sandwiches. he just looked at me, shocked, and said, 'I don't want a deep-fryer in this place'. Hey, I'm fine with the guy being pretentious and true to the stuff he's making and how he's making it, especially if it's honest-to-goodness Southern-style BBQ. If he truly was an artisan of the BBQ and the smoker, he can rightfully be as pretentious as he wants as far as I'm concerned. I probably would have answered back with an agreeing 'Yes Sir'! But the true kick-in-the-ass was that the stuff that I ended up taking home in a sad little brown bag was basically less than edible. In fact, I only took a few bites and ended up throwing it out, which is something I never, ever do. Someone went and filled thsi guy's head with the thought that this is actually what good BBQ is all about; someone lied to him.\n\nBesides being about honest and delicious BBQ, the Southern states are all about hospitality and genuine people; people that would never be rude or unwelcoming. They're more likely to invite you in for dinner than they are to turn you away. Drake BBQ was none of those things. The service was rude, inhospitable, and unwelcoming. From the moment I walked in, I felt as though they wanted me the hell outta there. That is, except for the older guy that handed me the bag. He sent me off with a sincere sounding 'thanks for your business', which is something I think businesses don't say enough these days.\n\nLike I said, this was painful for me. I felt ripped off. I felt sad. I felt let down. It was a just a plain bad experience that was nothing close to true Southern BBQ or Southern hospitality. In fact, I don't think I would even give it another go, and whether you've been exposed to true Southern BBQ or not, I'd suggest you don't either, because you'll feel let down either way too.","useful":4,"funny":2,"cool":1}

And it's easy to see why. Not only does it allow you to try more things on the menu, but it's also perfect for when you're  with a larger group. And that is just the reason why a couple of my friends and I headed to the Ossington area to try out Foxley, an Asian-Vietnamese inspired tapas house.\n\nThe restaurant ambiance doesn't mimic anything I typically associate with a traditional Vietnamese restaurant. It has a classier fine dining style of décor with ginger brick walls and soft lighting; it's a  perfect romantic date spot. In fact, we saw lots of couples there that night all dining on a few plates and enjoying wine.\n\nMy friends and I decided to follow suit, so we split a bottle of red and ordered the most interesting dishes that caught our eyes on the menu. This however, was a task easier said than done. The menu comes on a single-sided laminated sheet, with no pictures. It was hard to distinguish where the descriptions of one dish started and the next one ended. It felt a little like reading an essay! But once you get over the poor formatting, you'll be amazed by the variety of dishes that they offer. There is no shortage of exotic meats and dishes, like frog legs and beef hearts. But if you're not feeling that adventurous, rest assured they also do have many good old reliable classics, like deep fried shrimps, steamed mussels, and spring rolls.\n\nThe first dish that came was the Lamb and Duck Prosciutto Dumplings\" ($7). These were served hot,crunchy and  with jam packed with minced lamb stuffing. They're tasty, but nothing too special..\n\nNext came a Sea Bream Creviche with Yuzu and Shiso ($15). They're bite sizes pieces of thinly sliced sea bream sashimi, covered with coriander and some lime puree. I actually found them to be a little too citrusy for my liking, but it is undeniably fresh. It was paired well with the crunchy fried onions generously sprinkled on top.\n\nAfter that, a whole slew of dishes came at the same time, and it was difficult to figure out which one to dig into first; they all looked and smelled so appetizing! The Grilled Marinated Beef Short Ribs ($14) came on a small plate with about 3-4 pieces. A little too chewy for my liking, but it was at least well marinated and flavourful. In comparison, the Grilled Side Ribs with Caramelized Shallot Glaze ($9.00) were delicious. They were made up of two long pork ribs covered in a savory sweet glaze, with meat that fell right off the bone. We literally demolished that dish in a couple of seconds!\n\nIf you're a big fan of pork belly as I am, then you'll be in for a real treat at Foxley. They serve a Slow-braised Pork Belly in Muscatel Reduction ($15) with nicely marbled fat and cooked in a delicious smokey barbeque sauce ;it just melts in your mouth!\n\nAnd while all those dishes were great, my favourite of the night was the Grilled Beef Heart with Chili Lime Salsa ($8). We ordered it just to try something new, and it was the best decision of the night! It came nicely grilled on two skewers so that the hearts are slightly charred on the outside for flavour, and still tender on the inside. Don't be afraid to try this one, it actually doesn't taste as farfetched as it sounds!\n\nTo balance out all the meat we ordered, the chef recommended the Kale Salad with Pecorino Toscano and Lemon Dressing ($8). I love kale, so in my books this salad was definitely a good order. My only complaint was that the lemon vinaigrette was a bit too sour.\n\nUpon finishing up the meal, the first thought I had was that Foxley is not as \"Asian fusion\" as I had anticipated. There are some influences, but not nearly enough for me to notice the Asian aspect of the menu. That does not go to say that I didn't enjoy my meal though. While I found it was a little on the pricier side, I did enjoy the food and the romantically sophisticated atmosphere. Keep Foxley in your books for either your next date night venue or for a quiet relaxing dinner out with friends.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Everything from Southern-fried chicken and Tenessee pulled pork sandwiches to grilled veg stew and fried tofu sandwiches.

The staff are cool, layed-back, and they actually seem to care that you're there.\n\nBut like I said, all of that can change the next time you go in.

It's an easy little place to overlook; it's just a small shop with little advertising way out on Queen East. But boy am I ever glad I stumbled onto this place. Hands down this was one of the best burgers I've had in Toronto. \n\nFirst off, it was actually cooked a little over medium-- without me asking! Truly a rarity nowadays, the guy at the counter told me they always cook it that temperature. Beautiful. Besides being cooked perfectly, the burger was served on a soft and slightly sweet bun that was matched perfectly with the savoury patty.\n\nThe fries are cut super skinny and fried crispy in-house. While that makes them perfect for eating right away, I do imagine that takeouters will find them soggy once they get to eat them. But for me, it was pure fry bliss.\n\nThe space is modern, clean, and stainless-steel heavy, but because of it's size, it only has seating for about 4 people. Once the place gets a lineup, which at peak times is completely inevitable, the seating area gets really cramped and is unpleasant to eat in.\n\nNext time you happen out to the Beaches, definitely check this place out, or even if you're not in the neighbourhood, this place is totally worth the drive.\n\nCheck out our blog at www.tofoodreviews.com","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":2}

It has gluten free beer.  It has a cute patio and it's painted to look like a circus tent.  I chose it for all of the aforementioned reasons.  It checked a lot of boxes on my list.  I won't be going back.\n\nThis past weekend found me turning another year older, and because I've been experimenting with a gluten-reduced diet as of late, I decided my birthday dinner should be had at the Kensington Cornerstone.  I looked at pictures.  I perused the menu.  I read reviews.  It all seemed positive.\n\nIt was a beautiful evening, so I was happy that we snagged a spot on the patio.  We had to wait awhile for our drink order to be taken, but at this point we were still taking in our surroundings, people watching (Kensington offers some of the best), and trying to catch passing bubbles being dispensed from somewhere across the street. \n\nJust when I was at the point of helping myself to my neighbouring tables' pitcher of beer, our waitress appeared.  The up side to the wait was that we had enough time to choose not only our drinks but our meals, so we placed all of our orders to make up for lost time.  While we had intended to order one of their pitchers of sangria (and\/or mojitos, and\/or margaritas), we all ended up opting for beer.  My girlfriend and my mom split a pitcher of Upper Canada Lager, while I decided to try one of their 4 gluten free selections.  I figured having a wheat beer with my gluten free meal would be like washing down a pie with a diet pop, so I stuck to my guns.  I've had what Nicklebrook has to offer in the line of GF beer, so I was looking forward to trying a new one.  I asked our server what the most popular one was, and she pointed me in the direction of a red ale by La Messagre that operates out of Montreal.\n\nWhen our drinks arrived, I took that first sip so full of hope, and for a split second I thought I was going to have the chance to gloat in the face of my girlfriend (I know, I'm nice aren't I?) that my beer didn't taste horrible.  I didn't have that chance.  Did I just drink beer?  Or did I just suck on a penny?  Even I was a bit confused at that point.  It started off so well, but then finished with a strong metallic and bitter taste that seemed to coat my tongue and the back of my throat.  Bitter...just like I was at that point.\n\nSo by this time about 30 minutes had passed since we ordered.  Our thirst was quenched but we were more than peckish.  Thank goodness our server was coming our way!  But instead of food, she came bearing bad news.  My girlfriend would not be dining on the stuffed peppers that she had ordered as they had run out, and for some reason, they just thought to tell her now.  Not only would we have to wait even longer for our food, but our plan to share our meals was scrapped as we now both had the pulled pork sandwich coming to us. \n\n(Sound of clock ticking)\n\nAnother half hour passed and our meals finally arrived.  As hungry as I was I couldn't make it through my sandwich ($13).  It looked appetizing enough, but the pork wasn't nearly as tender as it should have been (I've been spoiled by the likes of Fidel Gastro lately), and the sauce was a bit of a turn-off, being too heavy on the tomato and cilantro.  The gluten free bread was quite good, and even had a bit of a cheesy crust but unfortunately it had been sitting in pork juice, so it was now more of a sponge.  Yes, a pulled pork sandwich should definitely be messy, but you should still be able to pick it up. \n\nMy mom was impressed with her salmon ($18), but she wouldn't complain if there was a gun to her head.  It did look good though, and the portion was generous, so not all was lost.\n\nLooking back on it now I wish I had just scrapped the GF diet and stuck with an old faithful restaurant.  What was I thinking trying to eliminate carbs for my birthday dinner?  Why did I go out of my way to both experiment with a restaurant and deprive myself of something I love on my special day?  Who does that?  So while I'm not taking the blame away from the restaurant, I will share some of it with them...but only some as the service was really what ruined our experience.  Maybe the food wasn't amazing, but the fact that we had to wait so long for it was the added insult.  The servers themselves were lovely girls, but somewhere back in the kitchen, the ball was dropped. \n\nAfter we begrudgingly paid our bill, I decided to throw the whole GF thing out the window and head to Ronnie's for a bottle of (gluten rich) 50 to end the night on a positive note. As we sat there on the patio I couldn't help but stare across the road at The Grilled Cheese.  Oh, what could have been.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0}

She helped me identify the core of our issues with Pepper, and we faced them head-on! I had a perfectly behaved dog inside my apartment; sit, stay, free, park it (code for go lay down)- no problem! Our struggle was on walks and going anywhere. Pepper is an incredibly protective pup, and any dog or cat we saw, from any distance, would evoke jumping and barking which was incredibly impactful on our lifestyle. I had zero control over him outside of the apartment. Brenda taught me how to gain control outside of my home, and brought a variety of different dogs to increase Pepper's tolerance to dogs and to practice my new favorite term \"LEAVE IT!\". \n\nLong story short, we are still working everyday to improve Pepper's socialization, but we recently had a doggy play date and he did AMAZING! I can go on walks without an overwhelming feeling of panic, walk by cats without worry, and can even take the occasional hike when we know we only have to practice \"leave it\" a few times :) I am no longer afraid to take our dog for a long walk, or to bring him to new places!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":2}

The pool is an Olympic sized pool and is not kept freezing (like at MAC) but is cool enough for the children not to overheat.  The deep end has a ledge around the sides that the children can stand on while receiving instruction.  There are several diving blocks they practice on as well.  The seating is great... concrete bleacher-like seating that is in the pool area and divided by a smallish wall.  While the area does have a strong chlorine smell, it is nothing like other area YMCAs that have the indoor pools and water parks... my eyes do not sting while there nor do my clothes smell when we leave.  And, while it is warm in there (thank Goodness!), it is not sweltering.  The parking is awesome here.  There is never a crowd.\n\nOk, on to the instruction, which is great... I have enrolled a 4 year old and a 9 year old in this program.  My 4 year old could doggie paddle and swim just well enough to jump off the diving board, my 9 year old needed a refresher for the swim team and was mostly doing \"illegal\" strokes that would get her disqualified in a meet.  The lessons are at 6 week intervals, which is nice as really long-term commitments freak me out a bit (commitment phobe!).  They are so reasonably prices compared to what we have paid at the stand alone swim centers, I almost felt guilty.  This guilt increased when I found that my 9 year old was in a class with only one other child. The instructor was fantastic!  He pushed them enough to work hard but feel accomplished.  And he got her strokes totally straightened out (no more lifting her head to take a breath in freestyle).  We did 2 sessions (one 6 weeks, the other 5 weeks (even better for my commitment issues)), and my daughter ended up in the All Star swim meet after summer swim team.  Which was a bonus, I just did not want her to be embarrassed swimming.  The 4 year old?  After one 6 week session, she was doing a version of freestyle, jumping off the diving board and I felt totally safe letting her swim this summer without having to be in the pool with her at every moment.  \n\nWe will be there this Winter doing their little Winter league swim team.

Supposedly, their other menu items (i.e. gogi beef stuffed waffles) are supposed to be better, but that is a chance that I am not willing to take.\n\nTheir decorations\/furnishings were quite interesting.  The first thing we noticed upon walking in was their Transformer-like chairs.  They had some anime characters painted on the wall and had some anime show\/movie playing silently on a tv.  The place was insanely dark that we were blinded when we were walking outside to leave.  \n\nIt goes without saying that I definitely will not be going back.  I much rather eat Panda Express on campus.","useful":4,"funny":3,"cool":0}

I time I never knew but always imagined as better somehow.\n\nEven though some of the presentation of the products and décor may seem dated, I sincerely feel that it is all part of the charm of this family owned business. I now live on the east coast, and try to swing by the store whenever I am in town to grab a box of French Mints for my office and get a few free samples while I'm there. It's always a hit with my co-workers. \n\nI also like picking up the individually wrapped candies, from time to time.  I find the factory store to have much more variety than the grocery store chains that also carry Cerreta's products around town. I have found this location to have a few more modern candy offerings, such as peanut butter truffle and mint cookie crumble.

Not because I particularly liked it, but because it was the main option for a slightly fancier totally vegan night out, with wine (the other tasty option being Vegetarian Haven, without wine.)\n\nA group of 7 of us went on their second day. Is it too early to do a review? Maybe. So take it all with a grain of salt. I hear things are still \"evolving\" and the menu might change. More desserts might appear. Anything could happen. \n\nThe Bar Snax menu looks interesting, and the idea of being able to have drinks and vegan snacks at midnight or 1 am, is promising, especially with Bar Chef next door (which has zero veganizable food options at all according to the last time we went...)\n\nThe Grasslands interior and drink menu is the biggest change when compared with Fressen. And those are really nice improvements. It's brighter, while still being intimate, and has a more open feel, with less cramped seating. \n\nAnother pleasant change is that the servers all seem friendly, and generally helpful.\n\nFood is very Fressen-like, so if you liked Fressen, you will like Grasslands. I had a favourite go-to dish at Fressen.  I ordered the skewer and liked it. Everyone else ordered the seitan roast or the chicken. Bar Snax menu is the biggest change from the former, and it's full of crispy and bite sized options.\n\nMajor problem on our first visit was that we went in a group of 7, which means an automatic gratuity of 18% was added to our bill. But there was nothing on the menu to indicate this, the person taking our reservation didn't let us know, and the servers didn't mention it. Since we're decent people, we obviously added a tip, and so, double tipped. Womp womp.\n\nI'll leave out the Facebook page drama that ensued after we commented about it on their page, but regardless, they did not handle the comments well, and shut off posting on their page entirely. Hopefully it was an educational experience.\n\nTo sum it up: Food is okay. Service is good. Bar (and associated menu) is great. Interior is great.","useful":10,"funny":2,"cool":1}

Fried tofu gluten fritters with carrots, potatoes, beans and cauliflower sounded so yummy but it wasn't.\n\nThe only thing I really enjoyed the flavour of was the potatoes, because they seemed to have taken on the most of the curry flavour, the veggies and soy\/gluten stuff weren't very flavourful. I needed some hot sauce for sure.\n\nAt least it was on the Special Order menu so it was only 5.99, some of the other items were 10-13.\n\nThey also wouldn't let me plug in my laptop and were generally kindof rude. so, eh.

Staff at Float were super friendly and helpful, and offered me a nice peach tea while I waited for my turn to go in. It was very relaxing.\n\nI've been getting a few questions about the process so I figured it would be helpful to have some idea of what happens when you walk in.\n\nSo this is what happens when you walk in.\n\nI had already paid and made my appointment online, so I just walked in around 15 minutes before my appointment. I signed a release form, drank some tea, and waited until my turn came. A friendly member of the staff showed me to the room I would be using, explained a bit about the tank, and some advice on ear plugs, then he left me alone to do my thing. \n\nThe doors lock, so you have some privacy.\n\nI had the last float of the night, so it was 2 hours long, but standard floats during the day are around 1 hour.  They have 5 rooms, each with flotation tanks in them, and it's easy to make an appointment online, which was a major plus.\n\nEach room has a shower, a bench, and a flotation tank, and a robe. Towels & ear plugs are also provided. They have scent pre-float shampoo & body wash you can use to get ready before going into the tank, and a more scented post-float shampoo and conditioner.\n\nThe flotation tank has about 10 inches of water, and a whole bunch of dissolved salts (for max float potential), so it's easy to get into the tank, sit on the bottom, close the door, lay in the water, and then open it again, or whatever you feel comfortable with. \n\nAt first I was a little anxious about getting lost into the abyss of the tank, and it just seemed to get darker, but as I found out, it's easy to find the door handle in the dark, and easy to open it whenever you need to. So after realizing it wasn't a big deal, and that I could open the door anytime, I closed the door, and floated away 2 hours without realizing it.\n\nWhen your time is up, there is music that comes on, and gets progressively louder to gently wake you or get you out of your relaxed state.\n\nThere is no right way to do it, but I had a great time just floating around with my eyes open, enjoying the feeling of gravity mostly disappear, and also got some really good stretching in as well. Just be careful with the salt water, as you might expect, if you get it in your eyes - it stings! (but there is a towel with a water bottle near the tank door if you need to rinse)\n\nThere was only a brief moment in the beginning of my float when I heard a siren from the street, otherwise, I didn't notice any street noise at all, and considering what I saw when I left Float last night, that's really impressive (lots of police activity, another ambulance that I hadn't heard). I'm usually pretty sensitive to sound, so mostly for me it was nice to have some near-total quiet and no vibrations other than the sound of my heartbeat for a couple of hours.\n\nI think they've got a great set up, and I didn't find their prices high (especially when compared with some other float places I've seen in the past) and they've got a variety of options to choose from on their website. \n\nThe one thing that is worth mentioning, is that after floating and being relaxed and blissed out, walking out onto Queen Street at 1 am on a Friday night can be kind of shocking (not like this is a surprise of course, it's loud, and busy). I know I'd like to try and do a late night 2 hour float during the week next time. Otherwise, I had a really great time.","useful":9,"funny":3,"cool":6}

It's the kind of place I could see myself visiting everyday for a coffee. Very friendly atmosphere, the lighting was great, and there was ample seating (but of course,  it was 10am on a Saturday morning). It was obvious this was a local spot, people coming in and out, chatting with Bob (the owner) like he was an old friend. \n\nI ordered my usual large soy latte. It was so good.

Also, I was very happy to see they don't charge extra for soy milk!\n\nOther things that are great: \n- They have free wifi (when I went in, the password was on the chalkboard at the front)  \n- There is definitely an outlet at the back corner. I didn't look anywhere else, but there is at least one!\n- There are vegan snacks, soups, sandwiches in addition to several nonvegan options.\n\nComplaints: \n- None really.

You get what he thinks is the freshest catch of the day. Total is around $14.00 for this particular order.\n\nAnd one other word of caution, especially around holidays and on Fridays, Wholey's can be jammed with people - I mean packed - so if you don't like crowds, or if you don't like standing in line to order your food and watch Andy make it fresh - then CALL AHEAD and place your order for pick-up. \n\nThere is also a decent sized dining room upstairs (paper covered tables) that you can eat in if you don't want to take the food to go.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

If not I highly recommend staying away. \n\nIf they made it simple with avocado raw fish and other non over powering tastes then sliced raw jalapeño over it then torched the butter fish it would probably be the best sushi roll here. \n\nVolcano roll was okay but really over done with the sauce quantity which took away from enjoying fish ... Which is why I go out for sushi. \n\nThe sashimi plater (30 pieces) was pretty bad aside from the octopus and 3 of the 9 cuts of salmon.... Everything else was off temperature. \n\nComplimentary salad was small cute and good. \n\nThe miso soup was good. \n\nTea was average. \n\nGinger is really good here.\n\nWasabi is really weak here. \n\n\nI hope the chef seriously considers the suggestion I made about the less sauce and torched raw jalapeño.... Ja Bistro has mastered it and it's incredible.... Maybe the chef should check it out and see what I mean. \n\nWould not recommend this place. Will not be coming back.","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I have about 1 3rd or fourth of my body tattooed and this tattoo SAVIOUR turned my several prior tattoo pieces (ribs, shoulders upper back) and with his new addition turned my body into a canvas with one solid flowing united piece. Brilliant engineer in designing.     \n\nAdrenaline is quite pricey ..but if you are getting it done with him IT'S WELL WORTH IT.

The food that we got was delicious (the sea bass skewers are amazingly soft and flaky, and the black truffle sauce that comes with the fried green beans is TDF), BUT the service we got was horrible.  Our server was fine--she was upbeat and tried to work with our wants, but whomever it was that also talked to us was horrible.  \n\nTo be fair, we were a large group (about 14 or 15), and understandably it is hard to accommodate such a large group, let alone trying to get our food out at the same time.  Honestly, I could care less if my food came out at the same time as the people I had been sitting with.  Before we could even look at the menus to see what was available a la carte, the restaurant pushed us into this 'tasting menu' that would \"incorporate our tastes as well as some of their classic dishes\"--sounds fine, but in a group of 14 or 15 people who have VERY varied tastes, that is almost impossible to do.  To begin with, some of our group members didn't eat any raw fish, and others were basically only interested in raw fish.  We eventually agreed to this tasting menu just out of an unwillingness to continue \"fighting\".  They tried to appease by sending us some shooters and edamame, grilled shishito peppers, and fried green beans to start.  Great, and thanks, but still not the best service you could ask for at a restaurant like here. \n\nIf this rating were about the food only, I would give it 5 stars.  The food really is delicious, and the decor (while strange) goes well with the feel that the restaurant seems to be going for.  The pork in our meat sampler platter was overdone and dry, but two types of beefs that were perfectly cooked made up for it.  The appetizer of some sort of spicy tempura rock shrimp salad was moist with the perfect amount of chewiness and spring; it's spicy, but not in the give-me-milk-to-guzzle-now way.  The sushi that we were served, however, was pretty sub-standard.  I'm sure this was because it had to fall in line with our tasting menu price point (which somehow got haggled down); honestly, I did not come to SushiSamba just to get spicy tuna rolls.. I could get that anywhere. \n\nIn short, come here if you're in a small group.  The food really is worth it, many times over.

Rehabilitation doctors are not trained to detect minor amounts of inflammation and use a pain scale of 1-10 to quantify a patient's condition, or use expensive and uncomfortable diagnostic tests.  For a minor inflammatory condition, hand therapy and anti-inflammatory medicines were the prescribed course of action.  Unfortunately, a minor onset of more inflammation from overuse is not detectable by the hand therapist either, who is also trained with the pain scale.  Dr. Xiao is an expert detecting minor amounts of inflammation and could identify both where and how I sustained it.  She used a combination of deep tissue diagnosis and healing massage, herbal remedies, and acupuncture to remove the inflammation.  \n\nNow, I am working with both Dr. Xiao and the hand therapist to build muscle and function.  I have regained a tremendous amount of strength and am well on the way towards a full recovery.\n\n2) I had a persistent skin irritation lasting over a year that my dermatologist could not identify and prescribed steriodal creams for.  Dr. Xiao recognized it right away as an energy imbalance in the liver channel.  She used a combination of herbal remedies and acupuncture and cleared it away permanently after 4 months of treatments.\n\nShe is easily one of the best diagnosticians and practitioners that I have ever met, and she truly loves her work.  I cannot say enough about how she has dramatically improved my life.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1}

He found nothing on the surface, as the carpet had been previously washed but gave me a great deal to wash it on his own, as he had high confidence it would work.\n\nWhen he came to clean, he was on time and very professional.

It does NOT get much worse than these guys.  First... a little background, I have never gone out of my way to complain about a company.  If you see my other reviews, you'll notice I go out of my way to rave about companies on here.  There's only 1 other negative review in my portfolio, and even that company is 4 stars compared to crappy old Appliance Certified.  \n\nI used these guys about a year ago, and the guy that came over was cool and the price was reasonable.  So I actually referred them to about 3 people since and kept their magnet on my fridge. \n\nHowever, last week my sink started leaking and we were unable to use it anymore until fixed.  I called this company right away (Thursday) to book appt for the next day (Friday).  No call... no show.  I called back later in the day simply to leave a voicemail.  Saturday I called back and they said they'd have someone out Monday (after apologizing).  Monday came... no call... no show.  Typically, I know you should give up on a poor company like this.  But, I decided to give them one more chance.  Called Tuesday, and set up for today because I had a busy week and couldn't do it until that Friday.  Next Friday came, they called me at 9am to confirm.  Whew... then... didn't show.  1pm I called them and a woman said she'd get on the phone with dispatcher and call me back right away with an ETA.  3 hours later... no call... no show.  I called now twice only to leave another message. \n\nBottom line:  This company shouldn't even be called a company.  The suck.  My 5 year old son is more responsible and considerate. If I had nothing else to do today, I would create 3 more Yelp accounts just so I can complain 3 more times.  One for every time they messed up.","useful":7,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The all you can eat is around $25 \/ person & everyone at your table has to eat all you can eat or no one can order it. If you order the all you can eat then you don't have to pay extra for rice (which you really shouldn't have to do if you put in an order for meat--but that's just my opinion).\n\nSeoul Grill recently revised their menu, so there are more options for different meats. They have added different flavors, which are so yummy! Try to spicy pork belly (sam gyop sal) that was recently added it's one of my favorites.\n\nAnd remember when eating meat first order not marinated meats then order marinated because otherwise the marinated meats taste will disrupt the taste of the not marinated meat.   \n\nI must say it's really nice not having to drive to Koreatown for a decent korean bbq place!\n\nOh and all the people who work here are so nice & helpful!

After getting my hair burned last year & then finding out that Hair City in Phoenix closed I wasn't sure where to go to get my hair magic straightened. I even debated driving out to LA to get my hair done in Koreatown.\n\nBut luckily I received a referral to Cleo's from a Korean restaurant and so I went here and am glad I did!\n\nI got my hair magic straightened (aka japanese straightened) and the stylist did a great job. Although my hair didn't come out perfectly, I blame myself because I recently had my hair highlighted at an american salon and apparently the american salon used bleach in my hair. And bleach plus magic will frizz hair. I learned this from the stylist at Cleo.\n\nI have to give extra credit to the stylist at Cleo, because he kept asking me if I had used bleach in my hair for highlights. And I kept telling him no, but he kept asking so I finally called the salon where I had my hair highlighted where they told me that they do use bleach when highlighting! (unsure why they didn't use regular color since I was complaining about how my old highlights had turned yellow, and now my new highlights are turning yellow too! I think bleach highlights is too hard on my hair). I'm really glad the Cleo stylist was so adamant on finding out if bleach was used on my hair, otherwise I would have had a hair disaster this year (like I did last year!-- and no I did not have highlights on my hair last year, last year my hair was in perfect condition, no treatments had been done on my hair.)\n\nI also saw that Cleo has machines for digital perms too. I might have to try this next year after I grow my hair out (since my hair is currently shorter than usual because of the disaster from last year)\n\nGo here get your hair done by an expert. He told me he was trained in both Korea & Japan. So he speaks Korean, Japanese, & English. \n\nI believe magic straight costs about $150, at least that's what I paid.

They took a situation that was less than idea at the All Star Race and turned it into a customer service win. Here is what happened. I used Ticketmaster to buy 6 tickets to the All Star Race. I browsed a few sections then wound up buying tickets in Chrysler section K. When we arrived at our section we were informed that it was a no alcohol section. I didn't remember seeing anything on the website (i went back and looked and there was at the checkout page and because of the way I searched I missed the one on the main page) or on my tickets. I was told to go exchange my tickets the gate. The employees at gate 3 said they did not have access to the Ticketmaster system so I would have to go to gate 4. At this point I'm not pleased but I head to gate 4. I show the employee my tickets on my phone and he hands in over to someone else. After about 20 or 30 minutes I'm informed by someone who I assume is a supervisor that the usher is wrong and that our tickets are not in an alcohol free zone and there is no need to exchange them and that the map displayed in the window of the ticket booth showing this as an alcohol free zone was wrong and out of date. At this point we have missed about a 1\/4 of qualifying. We head back to our seats and inform the usher that we were told that it was ok to drink here. He said absolutely not and that the ticket person was wrong. At this point I'm furious. So we walk down into the next section and head toward the bottom to find some open seats and hope we are not sitting in someone else's seats (luckily we weren't as most of them around us filled up).

With Pittsburgh humidity, it gets hot.\n- Wooden walls, so there's not a lot of grip for smearing\n= Price for a day pass is reasonable, but fees for little things like a belay device and chalk add up instead of holding an id for collateral.\n\nBouldering area\n+ Decent number of routes and variety\n- Stiff trampoline floor. Movable pads are big and effective but they aren't everywhere\n\nTop rope area\n-The top rope area is a different section of the building and even has different hours from the bouldering area, which is weird.\n- Ratings are labeled as Easy, Moderate, and Hard with +\/-. Why not put real YDS ratings?\n- For whatever reason, the ropes are just draped over a pole without any loops, so you don't get much friction while lowering.  Therefore, they require the belayer to anchor into the floor for each top rope. Not a big deal, I just haven't seen that requirement in a gym before.\n- Nonsensical rules. I got in trouble for helping my partner go over the safety checks. I passed the belay test, but I was explicitly told not to teach my partner how to perform the safety checks as a climber so I could belay him.  I was told this was for insurance purposes as they don't want anyone but the employees teaching. I waited for the employee to look away so I could safely set up a top rope.  Discouraging learning seems like a bad idea to me.\n\nMaybe I'm just spoiled by the great climbing gyms in San Francisco where I live but there are enough easily remedied flaws that led me to such a low rating.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Well, add to all of that, that the food is delicious. Maizal is a recent addition to the Liberty Village area. They have vegan and gluten-free options in addition to non-vegan\/veg ones.\n\nThe menu is short and simple. At the moment, the vegan options are: grilled quesadillas sin queso (ask for no cheese\/dairy) with either poblano peppers or mushrooms, the sopes with black beans, tlacoyos (bean filled tortillas), and opales (cactus.) All very yummy sounding options. Their tortillas are entirely corn based (and gluten-free) and made fresh every morning. (they also happen to be delicious.)\n\nOther things on the menu I should mention: the horchata. Traditionally milk-less, it's rice based at Maizal, with a cinnamon spice, and perfectly ice cold. \n\nOutdoor patio space is out front on Jefferson, and small but decent. Interior space is ample, but I imagine it's going to be an area lunch time takeout place pleaser, a tasty, healthy meal for under ten dollars. If you sit in like we did, you can read about the history and cultivation of corn on the very aesthetically pleasing chalkboards (and no joke, it really is interesting.) And let me say it again: Air Conditioning.\n\nWe each ordered 2 grilled quesadillas sin-queso (no cheese.) We sat sipping on horchata's while we waited and enjoyed the corn diagrams. They arrived, with pico de gallo on shredded lettuce, and a side of refried beans.  One poblano pepper and one mushroom. One bite and I've decided these tortillas are made of tasty magic. That one bite was all tortilla, and it was so rich in maizey-flavour and texturally superior to nearly all other tortillas I've had up until now (so I eat a lot of tacos...)\n\nThe fillings for both were great, both hearty and satisfying with rich savory flavours. Add some of the pico and a touch of lettuce and it is perfection. The folks at Maizal are doing exciting things with food, and I'm looking forward to seeing more, and eating much more from them.\n\np.s. prices are reasonable.","useful":7,"funny":4,"cool":4}

(right at noon time! what terrible timing!)\n\nI got the spinach wrap, grilled and filled with veggies, with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Can't go wrong with that combo. It was warm and fast. Even though there wasn't much reason to (nothing to melt, nothing needed to be cooked) I'm glad I got it grilled. It seemed to help keep the wrap together as I was running down Bloor.\n\nIf you don't feel like making up a meal for yourself they also have a huge selection of \"Chef Creations\" (at least one of which is vegan)  that you can modify further if you feel like it (for an extra charge).\n\nThe other benefit to this location is that Crema Coffee is right inside, so you can get a wrap, salad, bowl, or whatever AND get a delicious cup of coffee too. And by the way, Crema has one of the best soy latte's I've had in the city... though maybe I should save that for a Crema review...\n\nJust a note, I can never get the freshii wifi to work with my iPod Touch, but I can connect to it with my netbook.

Yum! \n\nAlright downside to this place is you have to be ready to wait. It felt like a line at Disneyland to get into one of those rides! The line was long! We waited 75 minutes to be seated and we stayed for 2 hours inside. Prepare to wait folks. It is worth the wait but do not come here starving hungry because you will wait and you will end up grouchy and impatient by the time you get to the cashier. Eat enough for about an hour wait and then be ready to feast! Happy eating1","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

We were picked up from the Aria tour bus pickup area, which is underground. Once we picked up a few more people at Excalibur, we were whisked away and headed out of town. A surprise stop was first on the list as we stopped at the famous Welcome to Las Vegas sign for anyone who wanted to take pictures. After this, we were were headed up through the mountain pass in an exceptionally clean bus with a friendly bus driver. Alan had picked out some wines for everyone to do a blind taste test (whites on the way to the wineries and reds on the way back). All wines that we tasted were of exceptional quality, although the reds were all tricks as they tasted  very different from the tasting notes listed and the grape varietals selected (no wonder most people gets the red wrong). The first winery we visited was Pahrump Winery. One of the owners, Gretchen, was so very informative and enthusiastic. She was such a delight to interact with and had answers for every question we asked. Following a tour and wine tasting, we settled in for a somewhat formal lunch. This lunch was way more than we could have asked for with the price we paid for the tour. My wife and I, being home wine makers and loving all wines decided to taste a few more wines (which I highly recommend). Some of the wines that weren't on the tasting list for the tour were even better than what we tasted previously. We picked out several of our tastings and Gretchen's friendly staff assisted us with setting up a shipment of wine to our home. We also bought a few wines and the staff discretely handed them off to Alan to load onto the bus for us. We were then on the road again and headed to the next winery, I would say that after the first winery, the second one left me anticipating an equal if not better experience, but I was to be mistaken. The second winery has only been around for a few years and thus has some work to do to build up their quality as my wife and I both placed many of the samples in the wine dump bucket. As well, the tasting room was a bit \"homey\". I hope they can make it work eventually, but at this time it was a bit of a let down from the 1st stop. On our way back, Alan made sure everyone had plenty to drink, but the entertainment choices seemed to be geared towards current pop music and not necessarily the demographics of the tour guests he had at the time. I'm not entirely sure that Alan knows as much about wine as he would like to let on. I would also encourage Alan to actively listen to his guests a bit more instead of just hearing them...if someone says they have interest in eventually opening a winery, the proper response should not be to bring up how expensive it will be or steering them towards another business where they can get help in barreling and buying wine. Listen enthusiastically and respond positively. Aside from these notes, the tour is great for the value. Those who love amazing wine, great food and education on how a winery runs will not be disappointed!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The bill, with tip, came to about $50 for two entrees and a dessert, which even for delivery seems high.  (I recently paid $65 for Chinese delivery to my office for four lunch specials, crab puffs, $8 delivery charge, and tip.)  I ordered the pineapple fried rice. I love spicy food. I'm the friend who makes fun of everyone else for eating things at 0 spiciness. I ordered this dish at a 6, thinking it would be on the hot side of medium spiciness. This was one of the spiciest dishes I have ever been served. It was inedible, because not only was it extremely spicy but the pineapples had been cooked so much they were completely flavorless, which is something I've never experienced before. So there was no balancing sweet flavor, it was just insane spiciness that overwheled everything. I am with a friend who also loves spicy food, and it was too much for him, too. He ordered another dish at a spiciness level of 3, which seemed to have no bite at all. Mine was definitely not twice as spicy as his, it was at least 10 times as spicy. I've ordered 8s and 9s that weren't this hot. He also was weirded out by the totally flavorless pineapple. \n\nMy friend's level 3 completely unspicy dish was fine; it was crab fried rice.  It wasn't anything special; just regular fried rice with a little bit of crab.  We ended up sharing that because neither of us could stomach mine.\n\nI am addicted to sticky rice. It's one of my all-time favorite desserts.

My boyfriend is a huge buffet fan, and we both love Thai food.  He got really, really excited and I couldn't say no, so we purchased our final deal of the day, went and ran some errands, and finished off at Thai Buffet.\n\nWe were the only ones there at that time, but we were a bit early for dinner and really late for lunch (I think we arrived around 4:15-ish).  The buffet is not your standard type of buffet where you serve yourself, but it is all you can eat.  Joann, the owner, described each of the dishes to us and piled our plates high with a variety of curries, as well as a bowl of soup and another plate of salad.  We couldn't say no to any of the dishes, they all looked super amazing.  And they were.\n\nMy favorite was probably the green curry; it wasn't as spicy as some green curries and it had green beans in it, which I love.  Everything tasted more homemade than \"restaurant-y,\" for lack of a better descriptor.  I felt like I was in a Thai grandma's kitchen, and it was awesome.\n\nAs we finished our massive plates of food, Joann went back into the kitchen and prepared us bowls of coconut ice cream with mango, pumpkin custard, and sticky rice.  This might have been my favorite part of the meal, but it's hard to say because it was all so good.  I'm a total sucker for sticky rice, though.\n\nDefinitely will be back.  You get a great value for the price (even without a Groupon, the buffet is $9.99\/person), with quality eats and very friendly service.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Even at half size, these sandwiches are plenty to fill up on. And, if we feel we can spare the extra calories, we will get a cupcake to go. YUM! I've also had a salad, can't recall which one, but it was fantastic as well. Sometimes we'll also get a loaf of bread to go, and we've varied the kind, all have been great.\n\nNow breakfast...ah, that was just divine. I got the lemon ricotta melt in your mouth pancakes with fruit topping. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!! And I got the apple sausage on the side. It was a little dry, but no matter since I was so full on the pancakes. All I needed was a mimosa.... Moving on, hubby got the banana walnut pancakes, which werer also oh so scrumptious. \n\nSo, we love supporting this place, and think it kicks Paradise's butt. We are wishing and praying that they would bring one to Surprise, although that might not be good for my waistline....","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":2}

Why, you ask? Oh so many reasons! Let's begin...\n\n1) It is not a chain restaurant! It is locally owned by a well trained chef. \n\n2) The Food. Ok, maybe this should be number one, but with the dominance of chain restaurants in Surprise, I think it is important that it is not a chain. But the food is FANTASTIC. I haven't had a thing I didn't love. My favorite is the Vogue Burger. It's big, but not so enormous that you have no idea how to eat it. The toppings are perfect, not overwhelming, and the meat melts in your mouth. All that yumminess for only $8!! What a deal!  I've also had the sweet potatoe fries (make sure you ask for the dipping sauces), the garden panini, the chicken panini, and the chicken salad (yes, we've been there a few times!) All were fantastic. \n\n3) The alcohol. No, I am not an alcoholic, but this is worth mentioning! The drinks here are great. I usually get wine, while my hubby will get beer. Both lists are great and reasonably priced (a great white wine for $6\/glass). Also, the martinis are fabulous. They shake and pour at your table and they have many specialties. But, what I love most about the martinis is that they are sweet, but not blast of sugar sweet. Often when you order a sweet martini you are blown away from the sweetness factor. Not here! They are just perfect.\n\n4) It has very chic decor. Lots of outdoor seating which isn't great this time of year, but is fabulous when Arizona has nice weather. When does that happen again? Moving on...\n\n5) The manager and owners are awesome. We haven't been there once that they didn't stop by for a chat.\n\n6) It is local! I am a huge supporter of local businesses, which can be extremely challenging in Surprise. \n\nOk, now for a couple minor negatives. These are not significant enough to drop the star rating, in my humble opinion. \n\n1) Sometimes the servers can be a bit lacking. I think this is because the restaurant is still new and still learning. So, we overlook it and instead take the extra time to enjoy good conversation. \n\n2) It can be crazy busy. I guess that isn't a bad thing necessarily, but we can be spur of the moment and decide to head to Vogue. Luckily we can usually find a seat at the bar and order there. \n\nSo there you go. The best restaurant in Surprise....you will wonder what the heck it is doing in Surprise. It is more Scottsdale-like, but without the snobbiness (no offense to you Scottsdale folk!).","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Things didn't start out so good...the manager wanted all of us to pay cash because he didn't want to split the checks! After we explained that none of us had brought cash (seriously, who pays with cash anymore?) he left for a bit, and then came back and said we could split the check. So, I believe they were just being lazy, since they ended up splitting the check anyway. If they had wanted us to pay with cash, they should have informed us when we made the reservations! Poor management. Overall the serves did a good job though after this incident. \n\nMoving along to the food. The green tea was unlike other green tea that I have had. It had a nutty taste to it that I didn't care for. Perhaps that is more authentic? I don't know, but it wasn't what I was expecting, and didn't drink it. The miso soup was excellent and brought out fairly quickly. Hubby and I shared the gyoza and the spider sushi. The gyoza was crunchy, but not too crunchy, and came in a boat. Nice presentation. The sushi was good too. Nothing out of this world, but good. Another person with us had a noodle dish that looked great. It had scallops, mussels, and shrimp. I didn't try it though, so can't say for sure. And the hot sake was great. Always good to have hot sake with my sushi. And to finish it all off...the green tea ice cream. Now this was delicious, and my favorite part of the evening! Nice and creamy, not overly sweet, but just sweet enough. \n\nBottom line: Don't go with large groups unless you have cash, sushi is ok, but the green tea ice cream is worth the trip.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

However, when we walked in another stylist was dying her hair and her kids and significant other were receiving haircuts from here when clients were waiting. A bit of time passed and all of a sudden another stylist started to fix his own hair up. So at this time, 2 stylists were doing their own hair.

I urge everyone to choose a different place to get their nails done for the following reasons; firstly she gouged my cuticle super deep as soon as I got there, it was bleeding profusely, dripping down my arm and onto the counter (which she didn't clean up the whole time) and her response to this was to give me a curt \"oops\" then squeeze rubbing alcohol directly onto the cut. Next I told her I wanted the shape to be between almond and stiletto (so pretty pointy but on the shorter side) as I'm watching her file my nails I have no idea what she's doing; she finishes and they're all oval. After phrasing it about six different ways she finally got that I wanted the tips sharper which prompted her to roll her eyes and say \"that's not almond\" uh yes it is. As she was refiling them she messes one of them up and has to take the whole nail off and start again from scratch! The whole time she kept forgetting about the open wound on my hand and would buff and file right over it (which hurt like a bitch) which caused it to rip open again bleed more, I barely even got an apology. Next was the colour fiasco, upon arrival I had chosen a lilac colour with a light pink for the accent nails, she paints the ring fingers first then when it's time to move on the lilac she discovers that it's dried up so she gets up grabs a totally different purple off of the shelf and just starts painting, I grabbed my hand back and asked if I could choose a different colour which prompted an explanation about how the lilac was old, which I already understood I just wanted to choose something totally different. So she throws the chip wheel at me and says \"hurry up\" now I was already at the point of trying not to scream or walk out before and that almost tipped me over the edge (she even pointed out how I was sweating, well yeah I'm trying really hard to not have a freak out) so I pick out my other colour, a grey, so she goes to retrieve it, she comes back starts to paint my nail and it's an orange colour?!? I ask about it and she replies \"oh that colour was discontinued this one is the same number though\" can somebody please explain to me how that makes sense. Yet again I ask to pick a different colour which got a similar response as the first time, finally I pick out a different grey and she finishes painting them. Once that was done she refiles my nails after the polish was already applied(?!) I almost asked to speak to the manager after it was all done but I just wanted to get the hell out of there so I settled up (it cost about $20 more than the usual place I go) this whole time I was perfectly polite and externally calm I even tipped her a little bit because as a server I know what it's like to rely on tips. I only went because this place had such good Yelp reviews, so I feel as if it's my duty to save anyone else considering this place it's worth 0 stars and as a veteran of acrylic nails I know when things aren't right. As a bonus not even two weeks later I had a nail break off, ridiculous.","useful":6,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I immediately contacted them, saying I had canceled the order - that I had told them I was going to keep looking and had not accepted their suggestion, but their response was that it'd been two weeks so they automatically shipped.

Lobster rolls were delicious- sweet rolls lightly buttered and grilled, then stuffed with lots of sauteed lobster meat.  The coleslaw they were served with was the best I've had.  The moules frites (mussels) came in a rich, delicious curry broth and even the fries were perfect.  We also had the pickles (three house-made varieties, thought they came with bottled mustard and not stone ground).  The smoked salmon quesadilla was incredible- with buttered yukon golds and fried capers.

However, their herbs and most greens are less than fresh and their selection of organic produce is lacking (and way too expensive when compared to Trader Joes, Whole Foods, or even Vons). They have a great selection of ready made food, but few healthy options. Pizza, ice cream, sushi, pasta salads, pasta entrees, vegetable and starch sides, etc. Some of what I've tried has been good, including salmon stuffed with spinach and pesto, green beans almondine, mixed vegetable rice, broccoli with peppers, etc. They also have a nice looking coffee and tea bar and a good selection of gourmet bread (La Brea Bakery olive bread, jalapeno cheddar, pain rustic, organic whole grain, etc). They have a huge bakery with donuts, pastries, pies and cakes at shockingly low prices, but nothing even remotely health conscious. Salad bar is run of the mill and cant hold a candle to Whole Foods, but again the prices here are incredibly reasonable. They do have an organic\/natural food section but they do not have organic eggs, meat, etc. \nI could not do my regular grocery shopping here, but this place is great for specialty items and anyone shopping on a budget. It is far better than a Walmart or Smart and Final and I like the fact that it's family owned. Their produce selection is worth a trip alone. I also find myself coming here when I get home late and don't want to cook- their ready made and pre-packaged food is available 'till they close at midnight. I wish they'd offer reusable bags, a discount card, and a juice bar among their ready made food stations. I also wish they'd refresh their magazines- I feel like I am in the twilight zone when I stand in line and see covers from weeks ago.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0}

I lived here for 6 years. We ALWAYS paid rent on time, were respectful neighbors to the community and responsible tenants. These apartments were great..... 5 years ago. What happened? If you are debating renting here, let me fill you in on what you are really in for. \n\n2 years ago the apartments sold to new owners. That was the downfall. Instead of taking care of upgrading appliances, upgrading the landscape for renters or properly managing maintenance requests; they chose to upgrade the front office and future tenant center to increase curb appeal. They chose to close down the main pool.... right before summer. The pool was closed for months. They offered no reimbursement whatsoever. When you sign a lease you are entitled to the amenities that were provided to you when you were shown the apartments. The mailbox lock hardly ever worked and was left open a lot. Car patrolled security (non-armed) that once existed, must have gotten cut because they were no where to be seen in past years by my eye. Apartment building security lights were left burned out even after MANY maintenance requests, which was CLEARLY a security issue. This last December, there was an armed robbery.... AT THE MAILBOX at 10pm! Two men jumped from the nearby bushed area with a gun and robbed a tenant. We no longer felt safe and it was (in my opinion) because of poor management with caring about the safety and well-being of it's tenants that were already moved in.\n\nOnce you're in, why do they have to care about your satisfaction and safety? You signed a lease and they know they have you locked in. In the last 2 years, our apartment has been flooded by the upstairs unit 3 times! The first was a faulty bathtub connection but the second time was due to a maintenance repair error (as stated by the maintenance man) and was repaired VERY poorly and took over a week to complete while we couldn't use our main bathroom. The third time (see video and pictures) was also a faulty connection to a washing machine after it had recently been replaced. The managment never apologized once for the inconvenience to flooding our apartment for the third time in two years. They also NEVER came back to fix the damage it left on the walls and pillars, as evident by the water stain on our ceiling and paint that was bubbled. The foundation for the apartment is shifting as well. There were huge cracks in our walls from who knows what. Our sliding door on our patio would no longer shut correctly because the door frame was warped from the building's unrepaired structure (multiple times we put in requests to see what was going on with this. Nothing was fixed, just noted on our maintenance record) \n\nSounds great, right? There's more. So you can see how unprofessional they are, but how about unethical? They started bribing tenants to put in \"5 star\" reviews on yelp to get entered into raffles for iPods and other prizes. They also, recently, started asking new tenants to put in \"5 star\" reviews to get some fees taken off their move in costs. If you ran a sound business with great satisfaction, you wouldn't need to bribe people into giving you 5 star reviews, would you? Shame on any business that does this. And last, but not least, we are (at the time of writing this review 4\/15\/16) still waiting for our security deposit. Like I said, we ALWAYS paid rent on time, for 6 years! And the one time we are LEGALLY due our deposit IN FULL within 30 DAYS of moving out (Nevada States Law NRS 118A.242), it has not arrived. We have called Jessi, the manager, multiple times and never received a call back from her. We received one email stating the refund has been \"processed\" but still no update on the status or postage date.They tell us they are short staffed and sound really sad on the phone but guess what? You are a business! Act like it. Don't make excuses, just fix issues. If I were to tell them 2 years ago that I had some personal problems and couldn't pay rent (which never happened, just example given) would they let me pay late or maybe within 7-10 business days? NO! They would have fined me and eventually evicted us if they didn't receive payment. These are not even all the issues we experienced but this about sums up our time there. It is not right that businesses don't care about the tenants after they have signed a lease because they know they have them locked. We should have moved out 2 years ago, that was our fault for staying so long. But we have now moved into a new apartment with better appliances and staff, 24hr armed security car patrol, maintenance requests that were taken care of within the same day... all for the same price we paid there! Do yourself a favor and look around and judge for yourself. I can tell you that we feel like Andy Dufresne in Shawshank Redemption when he finally swims through the sewage drain and is free. Good Riddance, Vintage at the Lakes. And no, you can't buy a 5 star review from me.","useful":50,"funny":2,"cool":3}

In a society full of high-speed entertainment (internet, cell phones and video games) fueled by a \"I want it yesterday\" mentality, it is refreshing to see something like Toys 4 Smiles. These toys are very simple, yet very high quality. It is rare in this day and age that a child will receive a toy that not only was HANDMADE for them but also requires them to use their imaginations. The way I think of it is that maybe some of these kids getting theses toys don't have a lot of people in their lives that make them seem \"worth it.\" Well, I am hoping that some of these kids will get these toys and understand that a stranger took the time to make them by hand and that a stranger CARES. They are worthy of it and deserve it.

We arrived around 5 PM, and it was not busy. We were not greeted or seated for a good 5-10 minutes after walking into the door. The waiter did not seem to know much about the menu or he did not bother to explain any of it to us, we ordered some appetizers. Most of the food was bland with no flavor. Their spring rolls are not authentic spring rolls, most likely spring rolls catered for non-asian. Let's see, it took about 10 minutes to get seated and the appetizers came out 15 minutes after we ordered, but after finishing out appetizers and waiting approximately 20-30 minutes after our mains had still not arrived. So we asked the waiter how much longer our main courses would take, he looks at us then looks down at his hand which had our orders. He did not put the orders through! This was horrible service and he did not even apologize, he would looked annoyed anytime he looked at our table. Keep in mind that when we walked in there was only 2 occupied tables. It was already getting late and we decided to wait for the main course. The pho had the weakest broth I have ever tasted. Everyone else food was either cold or bland.

I too toured the facility and I like Marc T was in awe of the facility and the cleanliness everything was so new and properly stored, I felt like if I had to put my baby somewhere this is what I would want.  I did in fact enroll my child for the summer program the rates are high but I figured someone has to pay for the amazing aquarium that was mentioned in the previous review and it included snacks and 'breakfast & lunch' so I dove in!! \n\nWith MUCH push my husband finally agreed to let me pay the fees which included a enrollment fee of 150 plus the first week, (you are charged weekly on Fridays) I chose to put my child on an easy-pay system where they would pull out weekly for his tuition Mistake 1. The first week they charged us our normal tuition plus enrollment fee (183 for 3 days mon, wed, fri & 150 enrollment) then no less than 3 days later they charged us again! This being our first week my husband and I were a little taken aback but we figured eh maybe a fluke,  after addressing the issue with  Kaylee we were told \"no worries, well note your account and we just wont charge you for next week\" great I thought lets move forward then 3 days later ANOTHER charge now I was getting a little annoyed.\n\nI don't know your financial situation but the tuition is high so these accidental charges were starting to hurt after the 3rd accidental charge. Again I went to the office and spoke with Angela the finance director and I told her we were a little concerned we had only been attending one week and already had been charged for 3 weeks plus enrollment. I kindly asked for a refund as I didn't mind waiting for the first accidental charge to catch up, I was more than a little peeved about the other charges. I talked to Selena and she told me that I needed to bring in my credit card statement that showed the charges...Lol I wasn't lying. Don't they keep records of what they are charging peoples cards!!\nAngela tells me SUUUUURE you can have a refund in 6-8 weeks!!!! 6-8 weeks because your finance department cant keep its records straight? I snatched up my easy pay document so fast she had a paper cut!!! \n\nSo I let it go AGAIN (really didn't have a choice we were 3 weeks in on charges) I continued to bring my son. When I would pick up my son the room was so hot I could smell the children's sweat but this is AZ heat so I figured man the AC must be working hard to keep this place cool and I would bring him at 8 so maybe they had just turned it on. \nOne of my biggest concerns was the child to teacher ratio, were talking 15 KIDS TO EVERY ONE TEACHER!!!! Why? because that's the minimum that the state will allow wouldn't you want your child to go to place that goes above a beyond the bare minimum? It was a ZOO when I would have to get him early. There was no less than 35 kids in the class at any given time. Great! I thought a great way for him to socialize with children his age. They called me less then 1 hour into his class saying that my son had attacked a little boy, when I went to get him thinking my son had mauled a little boy I was very upset he had never hit before, when I walked in he was sitting alone (I assume time out) which I am okay with but when I asked if the little boy was okay I looked he had a scratch the size of a sewing needle, not downplaying what my son did he should never hit but they are 5!!! They are learning they are going to get into scuffs.  My son came home on the 3rd day with a large scratch on his forehead I didn't say anything because I get it, they have scuffs and boys can be a little rough. After the 2nd time I chose to remove him from the program, just in time in my opinion I just got a letter saying they needed another 150  for supplies. Lol\nAcross the hall from my sons class was the infant room, my heart would break to see the infants crying with no one trying to console them. As a mother I know that some have no choice but to put their child in daycare and work but would you want your baby to be screaming because they aren't required to have more teachers in the class?. It just made me so sad to see this daily.   \n\nThe staff is SUPER UNFRIENDLY I actually stopped smiling to them because you know that feeling when you smile at someone and they look a you like you have gone mad smiling at them!!\n\nIn conclusion if you feel the need to enroll you must be okay with the following:\n\n1. Your child must NEVER make a mistake like get a little rough with another kid, if you work plan to miss a few days because you will be asked to come and get him\n\n2. Have an endless supply of money because they will need it. 150 enrollment, 150 for 'supplies' ( must be for the starbucks) plus tuition \n3. must be okay with unfriendly staff drop your kid and leave. \n4.Must be able to figure out their plans they don't tell you crap till day of!\n\nUPDATE: The school asked that I remove this post.....ugh I think not!!!!","useful":95,"funny":7,"cool":4}

I asked how the shrimp was prepared.  The server said, \"medium, we prepare all of our fish medium.\" Uncooked shrimp? No thanks.  We ordered two appetizers, a salad, steaks, and a side dish.  The oysters were placed on the table without explanation of the accompanying sauces.  The salad was good, tomatoes were fresh.  The lobster mashed potatoes had so much butter that it was pooling around the edges of the bowl.  One steak was overcooked, came out medium well instead of medium rare.  The server took it back and the manager quickly came over to apologize and offered to even cook both steaks again so we could eat together.  We felt it was handled appropriately and would easily have returned for future meals after this.  However, the steak never came out.  I asked the server after a long while to see if it may be ready.  She came back from the kitchen frazzled and said, \"it will be out but I don't have a time to give you.\"  Then a kitchen manager brought a piece of meat, set it down, did not wait for me to cut it open and quickly left. It was very fatty and appeared to be NOT the cut of meat (filet) that I had ordered.  It was over cooked, again.  The server happened to walk over and said, \"yes, I thought that it didn't look right.\"  I left without eating dinner.  She brought the check over and said, \"I'm sure you guys don't want dessert, so I brought the check.\"  The manager never followed up to see if I had received the new steak.  The issues could've easily been solved had someone not dropped the ball and given up on following through.  They did credit the check for two steaks, but really that was not the issue.

At first they were very accommodating, they let us see the room and discuss how we were going to set it up for our party and went over the menu's with us. It came as a big surprise to me when we showed up and had to wait over an hour and a half for our first course to come out! Everything just went downhill from there. We complained to our server multiple times (we had 1 server for a party of 40) that the room was extra hot and there was nothing done about it. I had about 10 guests having to get up to try and cool down outside, fanning themselves and sweating throughout the dinner. Then when half of our guests left I realized they never sent out dessert and we had to ask for it! I was then told we should have requested dessert to come out, what kind of restaurant waits 45 minutes to bring dessert after a meal is finished?\n\nMy BIGGEST disappointment was how the catering manager, Michelle, handled everything after I sent her an email. I understand that she is the owner's wife but I've had teenagers talk to me nicer than she did. She was brash and offensive. Not only did she not take blame for anything she blamed our party for all of the issues. You can count on the fact that I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone and will have negative things to say when asked; which is unfortunate because I work downtown and a lot of people always ask me for recommendations.

By taking me here, he definitely did as well as enjoyed the food himself.\n\nWe were recommended to try the Chef's menu and also followed it with the wine pairings. We both enjoyed the Ahi tuna tartar, LOVED the lobster pot pie, which got the pie to innards content right (I like a little breadness with each bite), and both of us were in awe of the Kobe with sear foie on top. I don't know if they still do that, but both of us just melted a little inside with each bit. It's in our top 2 of steaks...and trust me, we eat a lot of steak. I don't even remember the dessert, that's how mind blowing the steak was. I'm sure it was tasty and delightful because my dinner at Michael Mina was nothing but excellent.\n\nService was impeccable, and they dealt well with my constant requests for their delicious bread. The wine pairings were done well, but I was happy I was staying in the Bellagio after dinner because that was a significant amount of alcohol in one sitting. The atmosphere was elegant without pretension or \"over-styling.\" Probably the most comfortable restaurant I went to in Vegas. Most people were well dressed (i.e. slacks and dresses) but no need for anything over the top. I wore a little black dress and my boyfriend wore a nice sports coat with dark slacks. While we were probably the youngest ones there, the servers didn't treat us like we didn't belong there, which sometimes happens in upscale restaurants. Big plus for that.\n\nI'd love to go back, but this time, I'd probably order something different just so I could try other things...but I'd get the Kobe again. For sure.\n\nIt's worth the pennies to go, and try the chef's menu!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Something a little more creative (with same meat!) would have been lovely. I will say I really loved the beef-cheek ravioli - I stole my boyfriends because I felt my portion needed to have more in it. Personally, the wet and dry aged beef were good and \"beefy and meaty,\" but my preferences run towards melty and buttery type of steak. I preferred the dry aged to the wet...the wet aged just seemed a little bland in comparison. \n\nWe veered off course a bit - my boyfriend wanted MORE meat and we ordered the dry-aged bone in Rib-Eye for 2. I didn't eat much as my boyfriend devoured it, but the meat was flavorful for sure...just not my style. Ending with the tasting menu desert, which I can't remember because it was so generic. I think creativity could have been a lot better.\n\nService was good and they helped us find wines to pair with our dinner well. Our server was so excited we wanted more steak - but maybe he just wanted the bigger tip resulting from the massive bill? The worst part of the meal was being seated in an area that looked out onto the casino\/hotel walkway. I prefer people not staring at me or my meals when I eat. \n\nLastly, the price. While the cuts of meat were good, I just don't feel the costs justified what was done in the meal. The creativity was lacking and maybe it's because it's such a meat-BASED restaurant...but I feel like it could have been more creative. \n\nIf you liked dry-aged steak and big, bold Italian reds, this is the place for your. But I prefer my steak to melt like butter in my mouth and this isn't the place for it. I will tell you my boyfriend enjoyed it far more than I did. Otherwise, maybe try another, more diverse restaurant in the Palazzo\/Venetian Restaurant row.","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":1}

The next day, visiting me in the hospital, they raved about the quality of the steaks, being from overseas. I knew that next time I was in Las Vegas, I would need to go.\n\nWhat luck that several weeks later my boyfriend did extremely well in a WSOP event, and we returned to Las Vegas and made another reservation at CUT for mid June.\n\nWe were seated a booth with a leather tables and service was quick and prompt. We knew we wanted steak, but my boyfriend and I have very different tastes in wine, so the sommelier came over to help us with the (very) awkward iPad wine list. She helped us pick just the right wine that met our desires. \n\nAfter ordering our wine, we got down to business. For appetizers, we had the Kobe sashimi and the Roasted Beets with goat cheese. They actually balanced quite nicely, as we knew we had a lot of meat ahead of us. \n\nFor our main courses, I chose the American Wagyu filet, normally 6 oz, and added an extra 2 oz for extra. I love Kobe filet for it's melting butter like quality, and this cut was no exception. It was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and it was the quality and taste I would expect for a $130 steak. My boyfriend chose the New York Sirloin tasting that consisted of the dry aged American sirloin, American Wagyu, and NZ Wagyu. He ordered it rare and it came slightly over rare (which is acceptable, because these cuts were THICK) and they were epic. Just meaty and buttery at the same time. My steak-loving boyfriend was in heaven. \n\nFor sides, we had the mac & cheese, and spring peas with bacon. To be honest, we didn't eat much of those as we focused primarily on the steak, but both were good - also rich and bacony! \n\nAfter some excessive meat consumption, I saw a souffle float by to another table. I had to dig deep down, but I never regretted the chocolate souffle. It was rich but airy at the same time. I didn't even look at the other desserts, but it was one of the best I've had. The small little cookies and tarts were a nice little treat we had wrapped up to-go that went nicely with our coffee for breakfast the next morning.\n\nThe service was extremely attentive and water refills\/bread requests came quickly and discretely. (Yes, the bread was that good too). My one disappointment is the overall atmosphere. The overly slick design and mirrors everywhere made me feel like I was in an HGTV show instead of a restaurant.  When I think steakhouse, I think a little more comfortable and a little less \"sleek.\" That said, I also deplored the amount of  people taking pictures...man people, don't use flash in a restaurant, I like to eat my food without blinding. If you're so consumed by where you are, please avoid me at all costs.\n\nOverall, I recommend CUT if you have money to splurge but you'll be sure to enjoy your meal.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Milk tea was alright, it wasn't as sweet nor milky as most boba places. Thai tea was just like your regular Thai tea that you get at restaurants.

The chunky salsa was also quite good, especially for those of us who've deprived ourselves of tomatoes recently. Let this be a lesson to you (and me): read reviews on Yelp for recommendations on a new restaurant's best dishes before you go. Also, a note to our server: when a customer says his dish is just OK, then DOH! -- follow up by asking how it could be better. This is especially necessary at a new place.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

We walked through the Excalibur and, boy, does that place need to be brought out of the Middle Ages. As for the Trop, I'd like to put in a good word for the buffet at Cafe Nikki. It was simple and almost elegant and not what we expected from a buffet on the Strip. The cafe has a beach theme, which keeps things light and modern. Everything we tried tasted good, or good enough, and the desserts were crazy good.

Yes! So now if you want the similar portion that you had before, then you have to pay for it twice. I think it would still be less than what one portion was though. Which makes this restaurant now grossly overpriced. \n\nFor example, the last time I went here I had a combo plate that was the beef and chicken teriyaki with spam. I asked for no beef and replace with more spam. This is what I usually used to get. So you know what they gave me? 2 tiny pieces of spam! The chicken portion was also minuscule.

We were told that the room that they held for us were given to people that stayed longer and that our rooms were not guaranteed, even though we booked them about a year in advance.  That makes no sense whatsoever.  We told her we were part of a wedding party that had blocked a bunch of rooms, but they still didn't care.  When they said they had 2 rooms available, the rooms were in 2 separate buildings away from where the bride had wanted us to stay.  We told the lady where we wanted to stay and she said come back in a hour and they should be ready.\n\nWe came back exactly an hour later, only to be told they weren't ready yet.  The lady had us sit and wait 20 more minutes while she waited on a call back to make sure the rooms were clean.  They also had one room with a King bed and one room with 2 doubles, even though my friend and I had both booked rooms with King beds.  I let her have the King room, but once again, what's the point of reserving a room, if you aren't going to get what you asked for.\n\nMy room was okay.  I didn't have problems like my friend had with the sink and safe.  I did not like that you could hear people above you walking or running.  That was really loud.  Also, even though there are shades to keep the light out, it was still bright once the sun started to rise and that made me wake up way earlier than I wanted to.\n\nAfter the first day, my room was not cleaned by 3:00 p.m.  When I was getting ready to meet my friends, the cleaning lady came back around 3:30 p.m. and I told her I will be leaving soon and to come back.  On the day I was leaving, she knocked on my door at 9:00 a.m. to see when she could clean my room and I told her I was leaving today.  Shouldn't she know that?\n\nThe food at the Mexican restaurant and Marilyn's Cafe was just so-so.  We only ate there b\/c there was noting else, but it wasn't that great.  I would have gone somewhere else, if there was something else close by.\n\nThe bar in the lobby would have been okay if it wasn't for the jazz music.  I'm not a fan of jazz and did not want to hear it.  Also, the prices for drinks in that bar are ridiculous!!!  My friend and I ordered Shirley Temple's, which consist of Sprite and cherry flavor and they cost $4 each!!!!!!!!  What the heck!?  Also, a small bottle of water, about half the size of a regular bottle, was $4!!!  That is so ridiculous!\n\nThe pool was probably the only thing that wasn't that bad.  We were able to get lounge chairs both times we went to the pool.  I know people I was with were annoyed with the one waitress that was going around getting drink and food orders.  She was taking forever on some things and even gave food to the wrong people.  \n\nOn my last day, I had checked out and wanted to spend a few hours at the pool.  I went into the bathroom to change and I came out and put my stuff on the counter.  The cleaning lady was in there staring at me with an annoyed look, so I asked her if I was in her way.  She rudely said yes and I asked her if I should move to one side or something and she huffed out saying, something about coming back.  So uncalled for!!\n\nWhen it was time to leave, we asked the bellman to get us a cab and he waited about 10-15 mins until he called for one, which of course made us late to get to the airport.\n\nI definitely won't be staying at this hotel again.

Anyways, after my rejuvenating, relaxing, and gentle facial, I was gifted another sample. The Clove Gel! Immediately after using this gel, my redness calmed down, my oils weren't as crazy, and I definitely saw improvements on my face. It makes my face feel super smooth and cool. \n\nI just went in for my third visit, only to purchase that Clove Gel she gave me a sample of.

I grew up without proper dental visits, resulting in 4 decayed molars. \n\nAt 18, I took myself to one of those chain dental offices and paid over $1500 for two root canals. I was never given an explanation as to what a root canal was or that I'd need to pay for crowns separately. So, I got the roots taken care of but due to insufficient funds (because I'm 18!) I couldn't afford crowns to keep them secure. \n\nFrom 19-21, I hopped from local dentists to dental schools, and even Mexico to save money on the treatments (crowns, bone grafts). I couldn't pull through with most places because they were discomforting and too business-like. \n\nFinally I found this place on yelp and after the consultation with Dr. Walker, I knew I could trust his work. He thoroughly went over my teeth, proposed a treatment plan, and even broke it down into separate operations to help lessen the financial stress. Most dental places feel fancy and the work they suggest never seems necessary (like they just want my money), but here, I understood the importance of each extraction and surgery because Dr. Walker took the time to explain things. \n\nIn the past few months we extracted a tooth, did a bone graft, and a root canal retreatment. All were extremely terrifying at first, but I trusted him. Everything went smoothly and even when the retreatment got complicated Dr. Walker comforted me by staying positive and updating me throughout the procedure. (The scariest thing is hearing someone say \"oh no\" without a follow-up) To be honest, I was trying to stay awake so I could keep my mouth open; it was that easy-going in the room. \n\nI genuinely appreciate the work he's done and can't say enough about how great my endo experience was. \n\n*the receptionists and assistants are always a pleasure as well. It's pretty family-oriented in there so they tend to remember you!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Now to the good part , the rooms are spectacular because there all suites ( with a door bell  ) Beautiful view of the strip and water show ( if your so lucky to get panoramic view). We were lucky !!

Finally we got up and asked where our food was and it still took another 5 or so minutes for someone to bring it. The tacos were soggy by this time and not good. Aside from the bad service the food was just a total let down. The kids meal was gross and our tacos were soggy and it seems the oil was old because everything fried had a bad taste to it.

I walked in one day on the spur of the moment with my fiancé, and made an appointment for later in the week (when he wouldn't be there).  When I arrived with my mom that morning, I was greeted promptly by the friendly girl at the desk.  She got basic info from me on what I was looking for\/budget\/etc.  We then were led to the fitting area with my consultant, Tatiana.  After reviewing what I was looking for, she started to pull a few dresses at a time for me to try on.  She took the time to ask me what I liked and didn't like from each of my dresses.  She was really sweet, professional, and genuine.  I told myself I wasn't going to buy a dress at my first appointment ever...but after 3 hours of trying on dresses, and trying my favorites back on a second time...I selected the gown of my dreams!  Not only was I never rushed, or ever made to feel like I was just a sale, my consultant Tatiana made me feel like an instant friend for the day.  She didn't try to blow through my budget and bring me dresses that were on the high end of my budget - she really did try her best to make me feel amazing and beautiful.  I ended up picking a dress that wasn't even what I had in mind - and I'm so glad for it!  The manager was also very polite and my mom and I were happy she took the time to introduce herself to us.  Yes the store had other brides, and yes there were others looking in the mirrors, and yes my consultant had to split her time...but it's such an exciting moment - I didn't realize how much time was passing, and it took some pressure off to not have her there standing by me the whole time, allowing me to talk to my mom about each dress.  As someone who also works in guest service, I can tell you Tatiana was great at multi-tasking - she gave me all the time I needed, and when she was working with me, she had her focus completely on me.  When I came back to the store a few weeks later to pick up my ordered sash, I had another great experience!  The lady at the desk this time also greeted me, and helped me find the headpieces (since I now wanted to try them on too)!  A consultant who was in the area was really kind, and he asked me if I needed help, and offered suggestions for what I was looking for.

Their bacon board and apple pie moonshine is out of this world.\n\nAfter we had the bacon board, my husband and I took our server's suggestion and ordered their short ribs, which our server said were phenomenal. The short ribs come with fried coleslaw and we asked the server if we could sub asparagus and not get the fried coleslaw. So, the short ribs and asparagus come out. The short ribs were tough, small, and didn't have much flavor.\n\nThen, when our bill came we were charged the full amount of the short ribs and coleslaw, and an additional $4 for our asparagus, which clearly shows that it's $4 on it's own. So, why did we have to pay full price to sub them and then not get a side that was supposed to come with our meal? So, we basically paid full price to not receive a side, and paid an extra four dollars for asparagus that would have been $4 regardless if it was subbed or not. \n\nWe also experienced some issues splitting our bill and my husband and I were charged $30 more than we were supposed to be, even after telling our server that some of the items on our receipt weren't ours before she swiped our card. We were still overcharged and had to cancel one tab, but still be recharged for the other.\n\nThis place started out a wonderful experience but it seemed to get worse and worse as the night when on.\n\nI will definitely go back, but only for the bacon board and moonshine, not the entrees.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

If you want a new car, save yourself time and money by going to Power Toyota in Tempe. A year ago my boyfriend and I bought a brand new four runner from Big 2. They seemed nice when we were there but our payments were outrageous. A year later we decided we needed to trade our vehicle in because the payments were so high. We went to Power and they asked for our contract. We gave them all our paperwork Big 2 had given us and came to find out they never gave us a copy of the contract. They also told us our payments were so high because almost $8,000 of stuff was added on to our contract that we didn't need. They even added a life insurance policy for over 3,000...guess what...I was 21 at that time and my bf was 24. We had no idea that we had agreed to all that stuff and felt so stupid that we let them take advantage of us. Power Toyota pulled some major strings to help us because we had so much negative equity. Now, Big 2 owes us a lot of money in cancellation refunds and when I called to find out the status of our refund they said they'd call me back and never did. I even left a voicemail for the finance director, Brian, and never heard from him. My boyfriend went through the same thing. Today, after pulling some strings we finally got them to call us back and we find out they lost our paperwork. Horrible business full of deceitful, uncaring, unprofessional people. Toyota is a wonderful company and Big 2 completely hurts their image. Once I get my refund I will never do business with them again and tell all my friends and family to avoid them and go to Power where they are not looked at as a number but as a person.","useful":14,"funny":1,"cool":0}

From the planning of the ceremony to the initial consultation at the venue to the actual ceremony to the photo viewing appointment after the ceremony...we were very, very happy with everything!!  Yvette Prather was our wedding coordinator and the first person we had contacted about booking our wedding there. She was very helpful with getting all of my questions answered and addressing all of the concerns that I had. Our package included a luxury sedan picking us up from our hotel and taking us to get our marriage license and then to the initial consultation at the venue. The driver of the luxury sedan was awesome and super sweet...she even gave us a card to congratulate us on the wedding. Very thoughtful!! Once we got to the venue to see it for the first time and have the consultation, we worked with Danielle. She was amazing!! She was very friendly and answered all of the questions that we had. We were also very happy with the Terrace!! I could see where it would be a little small for people who have a lot of guests. For our wedding, it was just my husband and I and the venue could not be more perfect. We had another luxury sedan driver that dropped us off for brunch after the consultation, and he was awesome too!! Our package also included a limo driver to take us to and from the ceremony, and that limo driver was amazing and very nice and friendly as well. A few minutes after we arrived for our ceremony, they brought us upstairs to wait in the bridal suite. We probably stayed in there for 30 minutes or so before our ceremony started. It was so nice that we got to stay in there before the ceremony because they do have other weddings going on at the same time and it made us feel special and like it was just our day. While we were waiting in the bridal suite, we met Reverend Garcia, who was very nice and sweet and just all around awesome. We also had several pictures taken in the bridal suite, and our photographer was amazing and did a wonderful job. Our ceremony went off without a hitch. We chose 2 songs to play when I walked down the aisle and then when we walked out and that made it very sentimental and special. We were also each able to recite our own vows, which made it even more personal. I had chosen to have the rose petals sprinkled down the aisle as well and was very happy with that decision as it turned out looking great. All in all, the venue was spectacular!! We had a 9:30 PM ceremony and it just turned out so lovely at that time because the gazebo is lit up and looks beautiful. We were very, very pleased with the venue!! We had some friends and family members who watched the online live streaming of our ceremony back home, and they said that it turned out great and they felt like they were able to join in on our special day. After the ceremony, we had more pictures taken (which pretty much all turned out awesome by the way), and then we checked out by giving them the address to mail our marriage certificate to. After the ceremony, our limo driver dropped us off at Top of the World restaurant at the Stratosphere, and he was just as kind as could be. We had our photo viewing appointment back at Vegas Weddings the morning after our ceremony. At that appointment (less than 12 hours after our ceremony had ended), we were able to view a wedding slideshow of pictures that they had edited. We absolutely fell in love with the majority of the pictures that they had taken and ended up just purchasing our entire photo package at that time. The entire package is kind of pricy, but it is only a fraction of what we would have paid a photographer back home if we had had a \"traditional\" ceremony. They were able to give us a CD copy of our wedding slideshow, a DVD copy of our wedding video, and a CD copy of all of our wedding pictures in color, sepia, black and white, and thumbnail versions in hand at the end of that appointment...which means that we received all of that less than 12 hours after our ceremony had ended. And the pictures were high quality and turned out so beautiful!! I was floored!! Especially when I hear of so many people complaining that they have not received their wedding photos a month or more after their wedding. I was very blown away that they had everything done and ready to go that quickly!! It was awesome!! And the quality of our wedding video was amazing too...it turned out so well!! Everyone that we worked with through Vegas Weddings was very friendly, helpful, and dedicated to making our wedding experience there as special for us as possible. We would recommend for anyone considering getting married in Vegas to get married at Vegas Weddings!!!! I will even be telling people who are engaged and not sure of what they want their wedding to be like yet to go to Vegas just to get married at Vegas Weddings!! It is an awesome place!!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

This is definitely not a typical Italian though - they have eastern twists in various dishes - which make it different in a great way.  The dishes are simply more flavourful.  I love the various pasta sauces and seasoning that use saffron.  The chicken pastas, steak pastas and seafood pastas are all awesome.  I am not a big steak person and have also heard that their steaks are not their strong point.  The two poutines are really great as well - which again also are different from regular poutines as they have hints of eastern flavours.  Awesome restaurant.

My bridesmaids later told me that Leah was saying she didn't even want to be there...I paid her plenty of money to be there! I had to beg her for pictures after a few months and then got about 100 less than what was promised in the contract. Oh and no reception pictures! I don't have a single picture of me dancing with my husband or father. I asked her about this and she came up with excuse after excuse. Finally after 8 months and the threat of a lawsuit she admitted she didn't have any pictures from the reception.

Unless it's the only thing open and we're dying of hunger, maybe there's a slight chance. And if it weren't for the voucher we got, this restaurant ain't in our list to try when in Vegas, but it was a win-win, good opportunity to try since it's free dinner (with exceptions of: dessert, alcohol, tax, and gratuity)!\n\nWe were seated at a divided room where large parties were placed. Our server named Juan seemed a replacement as the main server for that area was slammed or should I say was too busy  favoring the group before us. It made it more noticeable after we've eaten as the main server took care of two other incoming groups seated in the same large party room. But what the hell, they all does the same, but to be determined to bring quality service, which I felt Juan didn't deliver well. \n\nI had Brazilian bouillabaisse which was a big meh! Bucca di Beppo or Bravo's, all located in Hawaii probably could have done a better version. It's pretty much a pasta with seafood medley of mussels (which the only thing I liked), shrimp, and salmon fish that's super untasty! My husband had Surf & Turf Rodizio with \"unlimited\" meat serving and my in-laws had Grilled Salmon and Skirt Steak (not part of this review) while my child had Loaded Cheese Fries (bacon, cheese, sour cream all OTS because we have a picky eater). \n\nGoing back to my husband's food that didn't impress me at all, even if there's different meat carvers who goes to your table to serve it, due to lack of consistency. They seemed to be favoring other parties and we had to ask either our server or other bypassing staff to call the meat boys. Not a big fan of dead carcass (I'm a wannabe plant based dieter), so I can't really attest how good it was for my husband, but I can tell it didn't really pass to his liking the meat choices and service. \n\nTo end the night, we had some confusion with our server Juan. I should have mentioned this beforehand and the server should've done the same with warning us with water charge per person. Like who does that? I guess only Pampas Brazilian Grille! Or the voucher could've printed it too with other exceptions. Plus, the way Juan applied our voucher against our orders were very out of order! Instead of simply listing all our orders and inputting the voucher at the end, he customized the receipt like they're trying to manipulate something. And call me stingy or whatever, but I didn't like the force tipping impression! That's why it's called a tip because it's up to the guest if they think it was well-deserved. At that case, he obviously didn't earn the whole 15% because I had to swallow my own saliva and drink from my husband's and child's water just so I can go on with my dinner. Plus it's not even ice cold! They charge for water back to the customers because it was placed in a fancy water bottle. There was also a lot of idle waiting for our server to get back to our table in between dinner session and the meat carvers were sparse serving and favoring table groups.\n\nGiving it two stars only because it was \"free\" dinner and experiencing the meat serving at a lackluster manner! Go get that voucher as a VISA card instead!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The atmosphere is like a casual dining spot but the prices we high for the offerings. My wife and I spent almost $80 on 1 small app, 1 dessert and 2 entrees. No drinks.  Both entrees were wrong as if they ran out of food and were plating dishes on the fly with whatever they had. Nothing we ordered came out correct except the water. \n\nApp:  Deviled eggs - good flavor in the filling but the whites were extremely rubbery. \n\nEntree 1 : Sea bass topped with crab \/ veg medley.  The Sea bass was good except it didn't come with anything that it was advertised on the menu. It came with fried mashed potatoes instead of the veggies , no crab meat, and had pesto sauce on it. I actually asked for the menu and pointed to what I thought I was getting. They brought my plate back and there was literally about 1\/4 of an oz of crab meat. My wife and I just chuckled. \n\nEntree 2 : salmon and cheesy mashed. Salmon was great, but came with veggies instead of mashed.  Come to find out they ran out of mashed potatoes and we were stuck wth the veggies.  Who runs out of a main side dish at 6:30p?! \n\nDessert: PB brownie cheesecake. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND CALORIES! Huge piece but bland and tasted kinda stale. Was also supposed to be topped with Pb cups. It wasn't. By this time we were fed up and just asked for the check.   We have NEVER not finished a dessert. We took it home and even the kids thought it was bad. \n\nService: average at best. Everyone had super awkward personalities and it was painful to have a conversation. Our waitress seemed to be frustrated with everything. She would ask us how we are doing and then walk away while we were answering. We waited for silverware on 2 different occasions.   \n\nTo top it off the UPS driver wheels in 10 giant boxes right beside our table to unload in the kitchen.  \n\nLike I said, it was a strange experience.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

It wasn't even a full night, we checked in at like 8:30pm close to 9pm, and checked out earlier than 10am to make it to the famous Paris Brunch, before head on over to our Time Share.  That's like 13 hours, including sleep and walking the strip for 5 hours.\n\nDon't get me wrong with this, it's a very beautiful and impressive property, but what happened after I left, can't be forgiven.  It's appalling, and I feel like I've been personally violated by the whole ordeal.\n\nWhen my Credit Card Bill came, I noticed 2 charges from \"Mandalay Bay\".  I called to find out what the second charge was about and found out that I had apparently been charged over $100 for things from the private bar.   \n\nI travel a lot, and know better than to touch anything in the overpriced bar, when there's the same exact stuff down stairs for much cheaper.  When I asked for a receipt of the itemized charges to be emailed to me.  I never received it.  I called twice to have it emailed, and twice they said they'd do it, and they wouldn't, so I disputed the charge through my Credit Card company.\n\n30 days later, my Credit card was able to receive a copy of the itemized list and below were the items they pretty much made up out of thin air.  \n\n--- half of this stuff, i don't even know what it is.  A \"CD?\"  what the heck.  What would i play it in?  Who plays a CD in Vegas?

It's Shady!\n\nI come to Vegas a lot and have stayed in a good handful of hotels on the strip and have never had any other Hotel chain do this.

So much so that I feel obligated in writing my first Yelp review in the five years since I've been a member.. \n\nThis is how the story goes:\n\nMy girlfriend and I arrived on Saturday 8\/26 to watch the Mayweather\/McGregor fight. Prior to arriving we called ahead to ask for the cover prices. We were told $10 at 4pm then $20 at 5pm and $30 after 6pm. So fast forward to arriving at the entrance BEFORE 5pm and to my surprise we were told we had to pay $20 since it was beginning to get \"unexpectedly\" crowded. So after we agree to reluctantly pay the cover, we were then told by the hostess that we were highly unlikely to get a table\/seats. Granted, this was after we had already payed the cover charge to get in fully expecting to at least be able to sit at the bar. As we enter we realize how insanely crowded it is with no open seats in sight. We could not even order drinks at the bar because it was so crowded. After a brief browse around the area we came to the conclusion that it was just too crowded and it wasn't worth it to stand for who knows how long and wait for open tables\/seats. By then we're both irritated and decide to leave after a few minutes of searching for open seats and squeezing through the crowd. \n\nAt this point, we arrive back home (no more than 10 minutes from Sandbar). Still irritated by the fact I had spent $40 for feeling totally uncomfortable and for something I didn't even receive (watch the fight), I call Sandbar in hopes of receiving a refund. We speak to a woman and let her know our situation. She tells us that they should be able to refund us, however because it was too busy they wouldn't be able to do it that day and to call and speak to a manager tomorrow. We make sure to let her know that we would be able to drive back and show our receipt if that would make it easier, but she continues to encourage us to call and speak to a manager tomorrow. \n\nSo we call back the next day to speak to a manger, however we are told that the manager who handles refunds was not there and to call back tomorrow. \n\nSo then we call back the following day, and to our surprise the manager who handles refunds was still not there and that he would be in the next day.\n\nIt's now Tuesday, and thankfully the manager we are waiting to speak to, Steve, is finally in. My girlfriend explains the situation and how we've been waiting days to speak to him and get our refund. Initially, Steve offers to give us a $40 gift card, however at this point we just want our money back. Steve tells my girlfriend he will call her back to let her know his verdict. Finally he calls back and VERY RUDELY tells her that he is NOT going to refund our money and even goes as far to take the $40 gift card off the table. He tells her that at this point, if we are going to want a refund, we must call corporate and immediately hangs up the phone. \n\nSo officially pissed off at this point, I call corporate and leave a message with Natalie explaining the situation. She tells me that I should receive a call back tomorrow. And now the waiting game begins.....\n*This review will be updated as soon as I hear back from someone.*\n\nNOTE: This entire situation has been a mess, and if the owners\/leaders of this establishment had any sense of integrity towards their patrons, they would make this right!","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":0}

After consultations regarding what I hoped to achieve I was given suggestions on what would work best for my skin.  This was done at first with Shannon.  She is terrific!  Very down to earth and funny. This really puts you at ease as you discuss procedures and financials; also important, given that these procedures are obvious luxuries for most people .  There is no high pressure sales and they always point you to promotions that might be coming up and how to get the most bang for your buck. \n\nEvelyn, the aesthetician is wonderful.  Very friendly, puts you at ease and really knows her business.   As I stated, I do have a lot of sun damage that has reared its ugly head in middle age. I will need to have more treatments done, but due to my outside activity I have to schedule it around times I will be inside a lot (summer).  After 3 treatments, there is a noticeable difference in my skin.  Many of the very prominent dark brown spots are completely gone off of my face and my chest area is almost completely clear!  It truly takes years off of your skin; which shouldn't be important but it is!\n\nI have also had lipo on my previous  \"baby\" region. I'm of average height and weight but after children even diet and exercise couldn't get rid of that belly bump.  The results are amazing, no more pooch or \"jiggly\" area.  Do I look 20 again?  No, but that's not the purpose.  My interaction with Dr. Hall from the consultation to the actual procedure was excellent.  He gives you a realistic view of what you can achieve with the procedure. No false promises. He said that I had enough elasticity in my skin that it would shrink back after the procedure and he was absolutely correct.   He is kind and has an excellent bedside manner that is all but forgotten in today's world.  \n\nI am very pleased with all the results and will be returning here for future laser resurfacing.

An immediate family member recently had to have a skin cancer removed.  Everything was explained prior to the appointment (procedure, insurance, etc.). There are no long waits once you arrive for your appointment and everyone is friendly and courteous.  You are not rushed through appointments and he answers ALL of your questions without making you feel like you are on the clock.\n\nDr. Guyette is very caring and shows a great deal of compassion as he performs the procedure.  As noted previously, by other patients, he personally calls you to see how you are doing after surgery; this really is unheard of these days.  After receiving the test results from the biopsy Dr. Guyette's diagnosis was absolutely correct and enough tissue was removed so that we didn't have to go back to have additional work done. The cancer was right below the neck area so it was highly visible.  It's completely healed and unless you are really looking or know it was there the stiches are nearly UNDETECTABLE!   Beautiful work......for anyone who may be considering any other procedures.   \n\nAs a side note, we have also been to the Scottsdale office; both facilities are lovely. Our daughter had cystic acne when she was younger.  We originally had gone to a dermatologist and didn't like the treatment that had been prescribed; a prescription that had a lot of side effects we were not willing to risk.  Long story short, we took her to Dr. Guyette's Scottsdale office and through skin treatments, approximately 3 (laser) and using the Obaji line of products her skin completely cleared!  It's been almost 9 years, she continues to use the skin regimen they suggested and her skin has remained cystic acne free.  She did have some slight scarring from the acne but thanks to the IPL treatments it really is minimal and undetectable with very little make up.\n\nWe never hesitate to recommend either facility.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

She needed fills and a color but after not completely understanding him and him acting like he didn't understand \"fills and color\" , he removed the \"powder\" he had put on and then because of what she needed done he told her needed to put the \"powder\" back on but there would be an extra charge because she had changed her mind and he had removed the \"powder\".  What?  We still have no idea what he was doing except charging extra.  She hadn't changed her mind he was making it more confusing than necessary.

Unfortunately our experience wasn't everything we expected it to be. The main issues that we had was that our countertop was cut into two pieces to fit together, which sounded fine. But they cut a straight line instead of the typical angled line that you see. The straight line makes it so much easier to see. AND the worst part is that the color is so off its extremely obvious to see the line. We just feel that an effort to match the colors at the line should have been made. A few minor issues is that the countertops didn't fit the walls because our walls weren't straight. Which of course isn't Stabella's problem, but the sales rep initially told us that if this happened on sight the installers would just cut the wall a little to slide the counter tops in so everything would be flush with the wall. But when the installers got there they said they couldn't do that because the line (where the two pieces were cut and were supposed to meet) wouldn't be flush. We also decided not to get a backsplash because the sales rep talked us into how \"new\" and \"modern\" looking it would be. But then when we ran into the problems with the wall not being straight we wish we had just ordered the backsplash to hide the issues in the wall. Once again, that's not Stabella's fault that our wall wasn't straight but we just wish the sales rep had been a little more realistic instead of making everything seem like roses and daisies. In the end this left us feeling dissatisfied because we expected different things based on the initial sales pitch. Going back to the line where the two pieces met and one side was much darker than the other, they told us that the granite cutters were instructed to put the darker piece in be back. So what that told me is that Stabella was 100% aware of the drastic change in color while they were cutting our granite ... And the didn't care or even think that would bother us? They just sent it out to be installed at our house anyways. They offered to have an installer come out and apply a darkening agent to the lighter side..but why wasn't this done when the granite was still in their factory being cut? It would have saved everyone a lot of trouble and things would have been done right in the first place. We declined having them come back out to apply the darkening agent because we were worried it would end up looking worse and then we'd really be screwed. Let me add that after we notified them we were declining their offer to come out and darken the countertops, we NEVER heard from them again. We NEVER at any point in the process heard an apology that we weren't 100% satisfied, they never bothered to reassure us that their work would look great after they applied the darkening agent and they'd really like to make it right...nothing. Long story short, I would never recommend Stabella and we've even gone so far as to give their name to some acquaintances and say they're who we recommend you NOT use. Stabella might get away with taking our money and leaving us dissatisfied, but we'll do our best to keep people we know from using them.","useful":12,"funny":1,"cool":2}

I'm 6' tall, so when my bride was at the store choosing a dress she specifically asked the sales lady if the dress could be ordered in extra long. The lady looked in the computer and told my bride that the dress could be ordered in extra long. Great! So I go to buy my dress, and the sales associate tells me that the dress is on sale for almost half the price. Great! I was ecstatic. So I pay for the dress, and as I'm walking out the door I return to ask the date that the dress will be in. The lady goes back in the computer system and says \"whoops, I accidentally did your dress as a take off the rack instead of an order.\" So basically, if I would have walked out of the store my dress never would have been ordered. How upsetting is that! Well, as she look in the computer system to actually place the order, she finds that the dress is discontinued in extra long. So basically, she lied to my bride when she told her that the dress could be ordered in extra long. So I'm polite and say that it's fine and I'll just order the regular length and it will just be short on me - well then they tell me that I owe an additional $50, because the regular length dress was not on sale. I asked to speak to the manager to see if she would honor the discounted price, since that is what they told me that I would be owed. And the manager was extremely rude and would not honor that discounted price. Super bad customer service. First, they lied to my bride - the dress was not available in extra long. They lied to me - they didn't order the dress, and it never would have been caught if I didn't ask them to confirm the date that it would be in. And then they wouldn't honor the lower price of the discontinued dress. Honoring the regular length dress at the extra length dress's price would have made me feel a whole lot better about the situation. They basically said \"sorry, it's not available.\" And that's all that they would do to remedy the situation. Very disappointed!!! I will be recommending to anybody that I know who is getting married to NOT use David's Bridal. If it weren't for my anal double checking personality, I never would have asked when my dress would be in, and the dress never would have been ordered. The wedding would have been here and I would have had no dress! If you are ordering from them, I would definitely suggest double, triple checking that your dress has been ordered. Otherwise, who knows if it will ever come in.","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":1}

While there were some hurdles (lack of cooperation from APS), we still received a 1st class installation.  The results are now apparent in the major reduction of our energy bills.  I look forward to a continued and long term relationship with everyone at PEP Solar.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Was excited to try this new restaurant. Came a day before they opened and the lady at the cash was so friendly and welcoming. Came two days later and was not greeted at all. There was no way to tell where to order ...the guy near the food just looked at me with wide eyes. I asked for a mix plate (chicken n beef) he cuts the beef and asks me about my salad n rice choice. He adds the salad to the main part of the takeout container which is usually meant for rice. As for the rice..he litteraly gave me 3 regular size spoon fulls. Then adds the beef...i told him its mixed plate. He doesnt aknowledge. Removes some of the beef that already has tahini sauce on it and adds some chicken. I go to pay and the cashier is on his phone texting and i was visible to him. I ask if this is where i pay and he says yes and apologizes...i gave him a 20 and later realized he overcharged me by $3.

My friend and I went to this Whole Foods this past Friday and had the worst experience. While standing in the area by the spring water, my 2yo was fussing. I noticed a customer and the cashier looking at us. The customer shook her head and turned back to the cashier and made a motion with her hand smacking her lips. The cashier laughed and made a motion cupping one hand and back hand smacking the cupped hand with his other hand. They looked at us again and the customer kept talking while she was frowned up. \n\nI went to them and said I know you're not implying I smack my child. They just looked; the customer still frowned up. As I walked away my friend still stood there and said they kept looking at us while making comments. \n\nAfter this we spoke with the supervisor who claimed she was the highest in rank there. She seemed to not care because she said I'll talk to him nonchalantly. She said I could go online to get in touch with the corporate office since I wasn't satisfied with her response. She also gave us a card and pen to fill out with comments about the store only to later come back and say she needed the pen back because that was the only one they had. \n\nBefore leaving we talked with a cashier who pointed out the manager to us. Then the cashier who was making the motions with his hands came to where we were and started talking to us saying he has a 5yo so he knows how children act up. Obviously the supervision said something to him. He had an attitude and said he wouldn't be talking to a customer about another customer and we had mistaken the whole thing. \n\nOnce leaving we talked to the manager about the hand gestures the cashier and customer made. He said he's worked with the cashier for years and he wouldn't do anything like that. He claimed the cashier smacks his hands a lot while talking and that when he came over to us told he apologized for his hand gestures. I told the manager our conversation was over because the cashier never mentioned anything about his hand gestures and only had excuses, not an apology. \n\nIt's nice to know that the Whole Foods staff sticks together no matter what from the top on down. I will find out if Corporate sticks by this kind of foolishness. \n\nOh... Before I left I saw the cashier pushing the supervisors cart to her car and they were chatting it up for a while.","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":0}

I asked the girl working at the reception if an appointment was neccessary for a cut and colour. She informed me that no, an appointment was not needed. She was nice, cheerful and informative. She told me about the current specials as well. I said that I would return the following day. \nThe next day, I returned to this location at 5:30 with a friend. We both said that we wanted a colour and cut. It was the same girl working at the front desk. She was disappearing, on and off the phone, and otherwise out to lunch - so to speak. She gave us forms to fill out with our contact information and told us it was an hour to an hour and a half wait - Really, no appointments? She then got on the phone and made herself unavailable. My friend and I stood there waiting for someone to assist us. Eventually, the instructor, who had been busy doing another sudent's highlights in plain view, came over to take our forms and she said she would call us when our spot was open. \nMy friend and I went to some shops in the plaza to kill time. 6:45 rolls around and we still hadn't gotten a call. We went back into the school (I don't want to call it a salon...) and let the front desk staff know we were back. We waited until 7... Nothing. They wouldn't even give us an estimate on the time. They said there were two people ahead of us. I struck up conversation with a woman who was also waiting. She said she also came in arounf 5:30 - for a ROOT TOUCH UP - and was STILL waiting. She made a good point... she could have gone home and done it herself in that time. I approached the desk around 7:15 and spoke to a student, the same student who was getting highlights done in her own hair earlier. She told me that as soon as she was done - and pointed to her own hair - she would help me. Um... ok.\nAt 7:30, we were still not served or given a time that we would be. I approached the desk and informed them we had been waiting 2 HOURS and that this was entirely unacceptable and bullsh-t. The same instructor that was doing highlights on the student earlier had only said \"I do apologize.\" I told her she should be teaching these students professionalism and correct customer service, neither which was present in this place.  I also let her know that I completely understood that this was a SCHOOL and not a salon, and that I therefore knew it would be a little slower but that it was common sense to let their customers know what was going on as we had been waiting. she kept saying \"I do apologize\"... nothing else. I asked once again what the time frame for waiting would be. She then said half an hour to an hour. I asked her if she was for real... to which she said yes. I then told her we are NOT waiting three hours for this... and told her to dispose of our contact sheets that we initially filled out. I told her, now with an audience of two students - one who was the girl working the front desk - that I had attended this location the previous day and thought the prices, staff and reviews looked good. I told her I had recommended this location to my friends and family to check out. I then explained that I would retract that and that I would never recommend it again.\n\nWhat a terrible experience.

I'm thinking of a Moroccan feel, very aromatic\/herbally, and very calming music.  I also imagined separate rooms for each service offered...What I had received is this..\n \nEntering on the 2nd floor of a very old building, into just a regular room with a high chair\/foot rest on one end and the manicure station next to it.  Also in the room was the Moroccan sit down\/waiting room along with the front desk.  So this small room consist of all of the setting described above.  Then in another room was the facial station\/massage station separated by a curtain.\nI wouldn't have such an issue with the setting but I did have an issue with the experience\/professionalism of the service. Please see below:\n \n1)  The short hand and toe fix is just taking off our nail polish and clipping it down.  Followed by continuous filing on your nails that actually was unnecessary because it was already to the skin part of the nail (that really hurt).  Also my cousin had stated that she had extra skin that is near her fingernail so it was already cut to wear she wanted it but the owner insisted she knew what she was doing and that she will cut it.  On top of it, she did not massage my hands nor my foot.  Shows that she really doesn't listen to her customers.  What is nice was the paraffin feet and hand that she provided.\n \n2) Then we went into the massage\/facial room.  I was given the back scrub first and my cousin was given the facial.  My back scrub was fine.  My cousin's facial was fine for the most part.  Now the funny thing is, so she gave me 20 minutes to relax and then came into the room to wake me up.  I do not think her assistant knew what she was doing for she kept asking the owner what to do.  Then, she told me I had to go shower!  What????  So she stood there in the massage room while I was naked trying to get on my robe (weird). So...she took me to a bathroom down the hall..the bathroom was so disgusting and I had to get up in the stand up shower to rinse off my back  and the paraffin hand\/foot treatment.  While I was in the gross disgusting stand up shower, barefoot-keep in mind, the woman opens the door and asks if everything is okay.  Who does that??\n \n3) After the shower, I came back and sat in the massage room.  She told me to lay down again and she gave me I guess at most a 15 minute \"moroccan massage\"-which was not relaxing at all.

I felt like it was the same towel that was probably from my feet.  The facial was nothing spectacular and it did not serve it's justice.\n \nI really, really had a bad experience with this massage place.  I feel mostly bad for my cousin because she's never been to a day spa.  What she experienced is not a good impression of what a dayspa should really be.  She was not a licensed massage therapist but yet she wants to do all services.  If you are not experienced..you should not do it.  It says on there she was a licensed podology.  She kept pushing her product line and repeatedly informed her that we were not interested.  At one point, I told her I was from the states and that I was flying home so I wouldn't be able to carry all the products onto the plane.  She suggested that I send it through the post office..ummm I don't think so.  It would cost alot of money to send out of the country.  And last but not least her hidden fees.  So I guess this living social deal did not include the taxes.  She charged 13% for Canadian taxes and then an automatic service fee (which I think is a bunch of bullshit since it was crappy services) of 17%.  So we already paid 99.00 for the services and then forced 30.00 for fees\/services?  Really??  \n\nI don't think I will be going back....","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Today was my first and last time coming here.\nLet's start with my experience with scheduling the appointment. I called the salon and was answered by a man's voice with a simple, \"Hello?\" I wasn't sure if I dialed the correct number since that was the only thing he said. I asked if it was Binh's Hair Salon and he replied with \"Yeah.\" As that should have been my sign to just hang up and schedule elsewhere, I proceeded to give the business the benefit of the doubt and asked if I could schedule an appointment. The man said, \"Yeah, sure,\" and hung up as soon as I said my requested date and time.\nSo, the appointment day came and I arrived early. When it was my turn, the woman at the desk told me I could sit in the next available chair. I asked if I could get my hair washed prior to my haircut and she quickly said, \"You can or you don't have to, it's five dollars extra if you want your hair washed,\" and I said yes that's fine. She responded in a way as if it were an inconvenience for her to wash my hair as she directed me to the sink.\nFast forward to the hair cut: as he was cutting my hair, he kept looking away and glancing at the door as he snipped my hair!! My hair ended up looking choppy and uneven. I was so upset with the results, but I didn't want to cause a scene and just paid quickly in order to leave asap.The woman's demeanor quickly changed and she was all of sudden super nice and polite as I pulled out my payment.\nIf you're wondering, no it has nothing to do with the language barrier, because I'm Vietnamese as well! They were just incredibly rude and unprofessional. Poor quality hair cut and poor attitudes. I thought the other reviews were more honest, but I think it's inaccurate. I probably could have gotten a better haircut and service from a student stylist.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I love Sashimi salads and have enjoyed many good ones in many sushi different restaurants. Since I am in town from So. Cal on business and wanted to grab a quick, healthy and light lunch between appointments I decided to Yelp Japanese restaurants in my vicinity. I was delighted to see Hanabi was close by and had a 4.5* rating by 150+ people. When I arrived at the restaurant at 12:30 pm, the peak of lunch hour, on a Wednesday I thought it was odd that a restaurant so highly rated was nearly empty except for one other table. \n After I ordered and my sashimi salad arrived I understood why the place was so empty. \nMost sashimi salads I've had are made with healthy rich greens and other vegetables and a pretty decent amount of sashimi  making for a colorful, healthy and satisfying meal. The size of these salads are usually served in plates about 8-10\" in diameter. The sashimi salad at Hanabi was made up of a small amount of ice berg lettuce, one strand of pickled carrot, a small clump of white shredded radish with about 6 small pieces of sashimi served on a small rectangular plate approx 4\"x6\". The cost of this sad salad was $15, the same as what I have paid in other restaurants where I got a lot more. After my experience at Hanabi I find their ratings and review very suspect. I know it was just one item on their menu but the fact that no other customer came in by the time I left really makes me question the reviews. Sorry no offense to those who have submitted good reviews. Glad you had a good experience but I definitely was disappointed, left hungry and very dissatisfied.","useful":2,"funny":3,"cool":0}

To boot, you always have enough to take home, now I know its american to over eat and one serving can serve an entire Vietnam family, but its good, to have some great lunch the next day.

I was in constant pain this past week & could barely open my mouth to eat. I found Royal Highlands off of yelp & I'm so glad I came here. The doctor told me I had an impacted & infected wisdom tooth and I should get it removed soon. The whole front desk staff was so kind and helpful throughout everything, especially Jasmine. The day of my extraction they made me feel comfortable and did everything they could to ease my nerves. Dr. Ho let me listen to music to relax and extracted my tooth in less than 5 minutes.

We had the mochi, taro ice cream and Sakura no-bake cheesecake.\n\nBig tip: if you're NOT getting the original flavour cheesecake, then you DO NOT need to line up. There was this lady in line that rudely accused me of butting in line, when there was a sign that clearly says that the line is only for the original cheesecake. So, remember not to be that person! ;) We're all there to have good food, no need to be rude! Just read the signs posted on their store front!\n\nOk back to the food!\n\nThe Mochi (2.50$): We ordered the black sesame Mochi but the girl gave me the red bean instead :'(. It's made with actual sticky rice! So it wasn't that sweet and kind of a little savoury in fact! Wasn't what I expected! It was interesting.\n\nThe taro ice cream ($4.50): the first spoon of taro ice cream brought me back to childhood memories of having taro ice cream in HK!! Which means it was very good, albeit a bit on the sweeter side. It comes in a plastic bowl with lid, not bad for price. \n\nSakura no-bake cheesecake ($8): it has a nice tart cheesy taste, with graham crumbs on the bottom. It tasted good, but I couldn't really taste the Sakura. It looks very pretty though!!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

We don't come here often though because of the long waits for a table. What draws us back, is the cha Siu here. It's a must!! For under $9 you get fresh and tasty cha Siu, big portion with a bowl of rice on the side! Other dim sum are pretty good too. \nOther than the long waits for a table, another little nuisance is the parking here. Never turn into the little plaza where the restaurant is, because there's no space reserved for the restaurant itself! The spaces there are all reserved for other stores in the plaza. So, drive into where the keg is and park there instead, then walk up the small slope to get to the restaurant.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The decor is simple yet fresh. It's a small restaurant but it feels spacious, so it's nice and quaint. \n\nPrices aren't bad but not cheap.

Warm garlic bread was served once we ordered, along with a bottle of tap water. \n\nThe pork souvlaki was the tastiest out of the three items. Very tender and juicy! The dip came with warm pita bread, yum! The spanakopita, though, was a bit cold and hard. \n\nAll in all, it was a nice experience. Food was good and service was friendly.

THIS PLACE IS THE SHIZZNIT!!!!!!\nSo my boy and I saw the travel channel burger special on this joint a week before we went to Vegas and we were all like \" YO CUZ WE GOTS TO EATS THESE MEATS\". So the morning after our first rage session we  were the first customers in line when it opened. There was also an obnoxious German film crew trying to shoot in their restaurant. After being rude to one of the lovely waitresses and refusing to wear the awesome patients gown we got to experience probably the greatest tongue lashing I've ever witnessed. Dr.Jon came over and told the German douche bags what they could do with the hospital gowns if they didn't like them. Dr. Jon is a true american hero in my opinion because like any good American he knows what happens if you let a pushy German get their way. His vision of american  badassness is a shining beacon of our freedom and should be commended. The burgers, fries, and shakes are  tasty, the waitresses are friendly ,beautiful and playful. If you're downtown you owe it to America to eat here.\n\n  p.s. Dr. Jon if you ever read this know that you are awesome and I am now and forever your biggest fan.  Everyone I ever speak to that is heading to vegas will hear my tale of how my hero Dr. Jon vanquished the snotty Euro film crew sent here to mock our American right to do whatever the f%#ck we want to. I will eat here every time I visit Vegas until I die.\n\n\nJust revisited this American gem and it was every bit as good as the last time. God bless America and and God bless the good men and women of the Heart attack Grill. Dr. Jon is even more baller than I remember, I'm pretty certain he is the smartest man to ever live.","useful":1,"funny":2,"cool":1}

Hungry, we finally arrived to Indie Ale House. To our dismay, the kitchen was closed from 3 to 5 pm; however, the greeter suggested Playa Cabana Cantina across the street for some good eats. What a suggestion that turned out to be.\n\nThe prices were a little higher for a typical burrito, but in my opinion, I got what I paid for. I ordered the CARNE MOLIDA PICADILLO BURRITO which is home-ground beef slow-cooked with guajillo-ancho-chipotle. The burrito had a beautiful presentation with green ancho-chili sauce poured on one half with a red, tomatoe sauce poured on the other half. Their sauces were fantastic. They also offered two house-made hot sauces. One was a habenero based hot sauce and the other was a hot sauce made from smoked chilis. Both sauces had a great spice. The smoked hot sauce went great with my dish.\n\nMy wife bought the Tres taco option - ANCHO BRAISED SHORTRIB-BRISKET CRISPY TACOS. This took traditional tacos to another level. As mentioned, Playa Cabana has their sauces down. The liquid in which they braised the short rib was no exception. This option paired extremely well with the habenero hot sauce.\n\nIf you are in the area and have no problem with $14-18 for a delicious entre, by all means, try it out. (Not to mention Indie Ale House is right across the street with tastey brews for a good night cap.) When in Toronto again, I will defintely come back.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

We planned to have dinner at T-Bones and stay the night.  We are locals, so this was supposed to be a nice stay-cation for us.   Upon check-in I was advised by front desk employee Yumi that no king bed rooms were available and we'd have to be happy with a room with 2 queen beds.  Even after showing her my reservation for the king bed room, Yumi advised me that my reservation was simply a \"preference.\"  She even threatened to \"call security on us\" if we continued to express our dissatisfaction at the refusal to honor our room reservation.  Instead of taking ownership of the shortcoming, Yumi chose to blame me for \"misunderstanding\" Red Rock's online reservation system, repeatedly talking down to me as if I were too obtuse to understand that even though I booked a room with a king bed for my husband's birthday, my booking was actually only a \"preference.\"  No where was this made clear when I made my reservation using Red Rock's online system.  In addition to Yumi's refusal to simply take ownership of the problem, she then threatened us with \"calling security\" due to our insistence that Red Rock honor my reservation.  I've lived in Nevada my entire life and have stayed at multiple local and strip area hotels, and have never been treated so poorly by a front desk agent.  Even after all the unpleasantries during the check in, Yumi then placed us in a room that looked directly at the parking garage.  I suppose that was her way of \"teaching us.\"  Although we went on to have a very nice dinner at T-Bones that night, Yumi's behavior toward us soured our entire experience.

My boyfriend had the 'special' which was Cioppino. It was 36 dollars and his stomach is feeling ever dollar of it. \n\nWe took our left overs because we just do that and don't want to be wasteful.

Not exactly a cozy intimate dinner spot, still retains that fast-foody 'get in, eat, get out' atmosphere of most places on Green.\n\nIn order to get a good cross-sample I ordered the mixed grill. Wait was a solid 15 minutes, and there was a steady trickle of customers the whole time (during spring break, I imagine they will be busier during school). The menu said they had hot tea but I saw none in evidence, just a soda fountain, cold bottle drinks behind the counter, and an iced tea server.\n\nGot the food to go and got back to the office. The chicken (shish tawook) was perfectly done, which for white meat at an understaffed restaurant (they had help wanted signs in the window) is a mark in their favor. The beef was also well done and mildly flavorful but not quite the explosion of spiciness that Layalina provides. The kufta kabob was also mild and well-cooked. Nothing was dry or tasteless, the pita bread was fresh, the two sides they give you, one was some kind of jerusalem salad that was 90% tomatoes so I passed on it after taking one bite for review purposes (yup, tomtaoey. Yuck. The things I do for you people) and the other was this odd, neon-pink pickled... something. Not cabbage, not radish, not sure what it was. Its not on the menu. I ate it anyway. It was... pickled radishy but not too strong. Serving sizes were more than enough for lunch unless you're super hungry, I was and still felt full about halfway in but it was good enough that by picking at it over the course of an hour I managed to finish everything but the pita.\n\nThe rice was a little on the oily side but good if again, not as spiced as Layalina. All in all this was a nice, freshly-cooked, healthy meal for a great price. I've heard the owners are Afghani so its possible the food is a milder form than I'm used to. Either way it was fresh, hot, tasty and a great deal for the price.

All were quite flavorful and tasty, and not too oily (something that happens often in this town with Chinese food, sadly). Could not stop eating the green beans, even my four year old liked them.

Nice touch: they weigh the buffet takeout, so you don't have to pay the full price if you don't load up.\n\nNaan: just ok, but I did get takeout so it might've suffered a bit in transit. Naan is best fresh and hot.\n\nveggie korma: very good, nicely spicy, good flavor, vegetables were good quality.\n\npekora: nicely crunchy even after sitting in a styrofoam box for a few minutes, little salty.\n\npalak chana: good, nicely spicy and flavorful, right thickness of sauce\n\nkidney bean chickpea thing I forget the name of: kind of bland, I usually expect more fire in this dish.\n\ntandoori chicken: not great, surprisingly. It was dry and surprisingly hot (spice wise) while being less flavorful than I'm used to. Maybe it'd just been sitting around for awhile (its hard to make dark meat dry!)\n\nlemon rice: yellow rice with fried peanuts in it. I liked the peanuts, gave it a nice crunch, but didn't really taste anything else flavor wise; could've just been plain old basmati rice.\n\nchicken curry: ok, this is why this place dropped a full star. The chicken curry is bone in, which would be fine if it were whole bone, but the bone is cleaver-chopped, which leaves tiny shards of barely-detectable bone EVERYWHERE. Seriously I was picking through this thing like I was dissecting in a lab to make sure I didn't kill myself with every bite. I don't even remember how it tasted. I realize this is 'authentic' but so is using a cow-dung oven to make naan and I'm betting they don't do that. Debone your chicken curry, you're gonna get sued.\n\nThe interior decor is really quite nice (a huge change from when it was Wonderdogs, you won't recognize the place), the music wasn't too loud, there was a refreshing lack of tv blaring in the corner, the proprietors are very nice and conscientious, and things were moving along well in such a tight space (you're not going to like it at lunch rush if you're claustrophobic\/have a phobia of strange people bumping up against\/brushing by you). The vegetarian dishes are better than the meat dishes, and I didn't try everything available on the lunch buffet (two or three more items, a lentil soup, desserts (mango custard sounds really good but I didn't want to mingle flavors).\n\nFeels like the vegetarian dishes were better than the meat-based ones, and there is plenty of vegetarian on offer. Wish they'd add samosas to the buffet. Overall I'd recommend it if you want Indian buffet but don't want\/don't have time to leave campus, just avoid the chicken curry, especially if you're feeding kids or something.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0}

This is not a sit down place, its counter only, but the owners are pleasant and chatty, the place spotless, and the pizza is awesome. Try the dessert pizza too.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

We arrived on Easter Sunday to a clean facility, short line and speedy assistance.

Another rep showed us several cars  to choose from and answered our questions with patience and professionalism.  Returning the car was just as easy.\n\nI removed one star because the rep made a point of emphasizing that Arizona is a \"no-fault\" state and we'd be liable for lost use of the car if it landed in the shop, regardless of whether the other driver was at fault.  With over $200 in added insurance and a $10 a day upgrade, our original weekly rental of $197 burgeoned into well over $525.  \n\nI don't blame Enterprise - we should have researched our liability in advance.

DO NOT use this company!  An estate sale is usually held at a time of stress, death, or moving to a retirement home, when you are vulnerable. That was not my situation, but she CANNOT BE TRUSTED with your family belongings!  Both houses were complete turn-key rentals with all furniture, décor, household goods, linens, etc.  Some of the items were exquisite, especially compared to the other sales shown on her website. There was a mix of things and various quality and values.  I had already conducted three of my own estate sales for other vacation homes that my company was emptying out, and I didn't have time to do another sale. I made a lot of money at my own sales, and I know what stuff sells and what doesn't.  I am also an avid estate\/garage sale shopper, so I do know prices. I was going out of town, so I thought this was a great idea - WRONG!  I feel scammed and robbed.  So many things went wrong -- I can't possibly list them all here.  Numerous people told me later that they had been at the sale and said it was very disorganized, nothing was priced, she was on the phone all the time, was just stuffing money into her overalls and not accounting for anything at all!  She doesn't say what she sold major items for (even though I had set minimum prices), provides no accounting whatsoever, and she brought over a lot of her own JUNK to sell.  I think she keeps stuff left over from other sales  (she says she donates it), and then she sells it and pockets the money herself, mixing up the funds of her clients.  Damage was done to both houses from people moving furniture, the carpets were filthy, and items were stolen, including a fixture from the shower!  There were only 3 people working both houses and she had told me there would be 5 -- 2 people at each house, plus herself.  How else could you make sure people weren't stealing stuff, if there is no one there watching?!  Something doesn't add up about this company, and I cannot believe she is still in business.  She also doesn't tell you what the extra fees will be for signs, email blasts, etc.  Very deceptive.","useful":16,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I made the reservation online and paid with a credit card.  When I checked in, I was told that because I am a local, they thought I might be having a PARTY in the room, so there would be a $250 PER NIGHT security deposit, for a total of $750.  I am a single 58 year old woman, not a 21 year old party animal!  The $750 was charged to my credit card, not as a hold, but as an actual charge, and it will take several days after check-out to be credited back to my card.  I did not rent a big suite and the room I had was certainly not big enough to have a party.  The Palms is known for their big party suites--why else would you rent a big party suite if you were NOT going to have a party?  According to their logic, locals might have a party in their room, but tourists pack 6 guests in their basic small room and that is NOT a party?  It's the tourists that come here to party!  If I wanted to have a party, I would have it at my house, not a small hotel room with no refrigerator!  Why was the security deposit $250 PER NIGHT?  Obviously, when the maid cleaned the room after the first and second day, she could see that I had not had a party there the night before.  I am thoroughly insulted and will not stay at the Palms again for my next staycation.  Also, the resort fee of over $30 is a joke.  I know all the hotels here do it, but why is that legal?  Since it is not an optional charge, it should be part of the room rate.  It doesn't even include decent WiFi.  You have to pay extra to get faster than a 1 mg speed.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

After our nachos he came by, tossed all of our food to the right of the table without saying anything (he knocked over the bowl of guacamole and shoved my arm in the process) and then promptly sat a family of four...right at our table. I've never experienced something so incredibly awkward and bizarre. He took our water jug, put it on their side, then took our water glasses--which I drank out of--and put it in front of them. That family somehow got their tacos before we did, ate, left, then another group of 3 came and were seated right at our table--elbow to elbow--again.\n\nNever, ever going back here.

Completely startled we all glance at each other wondering if that really just happened. Followed by 2 other moms I walk to the room, concerned. When i asked Coach Shauna what was wrong she told me that the girls were just not listening. I told her that if she ever has a problem with my daughter to send her out of class, that i am always in the other room and that i do not approve of her yelling at her. the other mothers also voiced their concern in which Coach Shauna replied &quot;if you dont want your kid in my class they don't have to be&quot; Hello?! Last I knew I payed to have my kid in this class and never once did I sign her up to be disciplined especially in that manner! After requesting to speak with the manager about the incident and them returning my call after they reviewed the tape i was informed that they cant have the class disrupted.

After staying there for one year, keeping the place clean, and finishing my MBA at Thunderbird, I moved out (along with my roommate).  We made an appointment to meet with the maintenance personnel to do a walk-through of the place before leaving because we had heard that the complex was unfairly keeping people's security deposits.  After the walk-through, the maintenance person said everything was fine.  The carpet was vacuumed and everything was clean.  Then, 3 weeks later I get my security deposit notice-  that they have taken my deposit and they want me to pay $75.00 beyond it.  \n\nManagement told me there was nothing I could do about it.  I also had issues with rude management during an extension of my lease and adding somebody onto the lease.  I escalated the case to rkproperties management and they claimed that they took pictures of stains on carpets.  Also, my roommate had opened the microwave one day and a piece of the top fell off . . .just fell off!  We were told that it was 'damaged' above normal wear and tear and the maintenance personnel's word was the last.  Since when is opening a microwave door 'damage?'  It was probably broken before we even moved in.  Again, we were told that the maintenance personnel had the last word.  Seriously?  This is how you treat part of your largest group of renters, business school students?\n\nWe had domestic violence in the apartment below us, ambulances came, they were screaming and yelling and fighting all the time.  And the apartment management chooses quiet students, with other potential quiet, orderly renting friends, to pick on.  That's just bad business, and I will not recommend ANY TBird to go there.

I've had their italian sausage sandwich (decent), the philly cheese sandwich (pretty good), pastrami (pretty good) and their chef salad. The chef salad is quite decent but they put these onions on it that look like they were meant to be battered and deep fried for onion rings. They were so large and overpowering that I started requesting to leave them off of the salad. Overall, the food has been decent, but this last time, I decided to get a small order of chili cheese fries. My God, that was a mistake. The chili was obviously out of a can...easily mistaken for dog food (even the smell took me for a loop). The cheese was like cheez-wiz....not appetizing at all. And like many reviewers stated, the fries were soggy. The fries are ALWAYS soggy. They don't punch a hole in the containers to let the steam out so once they're delivered, they are too far gone. \n\nAs for the delivery time, that's absolutely crazy too. For being in a fairly close proximity to their establishment, they sure take a LONG time, even if it's just an order of salads for myself and my co-workers. The delivery guy is different every single time and they are often a bit rude. \n\nMy co-worker ordered the chef salad yesterday, but was told they increased the price by almost $2.00. We unanimously agreed that we'll find some place new to get lunch. \n\nThe only reason I gave this place 2 stars is because I can't lie and say they don't have good food, they do. But when you wait well over an hour for your food, you hope it at least tastes good, and when something as easy as chili cheese fries is as egregiously bad as it was yesterday, it's hard to want to eat there again.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I am not able to say my experience with the car I was sold was a good one. In the first 3 months the car was in the mechanics shop 5 separate times. The first problem happened in the first 48 hours. Granted the dealership paid for that repair since the warranty refused to. And the fifth trip to the mechanic was also paid for by the dealer. None the less, when the first problem happened I was told that if trouble persisted I would be placed in a different vehicle. 5 separate trips to the mechanic showed a persisting problem. I wasn't placed in a different vehicle. This vehicle has been nothing but a money pit from the start. I will not be replacing the engine. \n    This vehicle has not been reliable. I felt I was left no other choice but to go and get a new car that is reliable from a reputable dealership. I understand that there are people that have had good experiences with getting a car from good carma. Unfortunately I cannot say my experience was among them. I paid for a 3 month warranty that refused to cover repairs that were included in the warranty agreement. \n    So here is my revised and updated review.

We were browsing the flavours when two other girls came into the store.  The employee then talked to them and they seemed to be friends.  After two minutes, we were ready to order and the employee was still talking to the two girls for around 5-10 minutes.  She also served them first! (Ha!)

The employee also looked annoyed that she had to stop her conversation 'cus we wanted to order something... so anyway, we asked her if she had the Cookies & Cream flavour and she just replied, \"No.\"  That's it!  and then she went back to her friends.

The bruschetta was delicious and the tartufo was good as well so it was just the pasta sauces that could have used a bit more salt, or extra oomph. \n\nComparing this restaurant to Michael's Back Door on Lakeshore, I'd prefer Michael's Back Door.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The schnitzel is my favourite dish there, though sometimes I'll get one of the specials (usually when they have duck or veal). All of the desserts I've had there have been delicious, my favourite being the dobos torte. However since this is apparently a difficult dessert to make, it's unusual that they have it. \n\nOver the past year, this restaurant has lost most of their regular staff and has seemed to suffer from that. Now that those staff have been around for 6-8 months, they finally seem to be getting in to a groove and service isn't as slow as it was months ago. We've never had unfriendly service here, just slow at times. \n\nThe portion sizes also seem to have decreased a bit. With the schnitzel, I have to ask for extra mushroom sauce because the small cup they serve isn't enough. That said, the price point at this restaurant is very fair. \n\nThere is a patio to sit on, but it's right beside Dundas and can be a bit noisy at times, though it is nice to sit outside. \n\nI'm sure we'll continue to return to The Apricot Tree, though it would be nice to see different specials or menu items as it seems to always be the same.

The patio itself is quite small but we were the only people out there and since this restaurant is set back from Lakeshore, it was quite pleasant. \n\nThe food was very good and worthy of more stars. The bread served at the table was incredibly fresh. Since this is a wine bar, there's a decent selection of wines and we tried something we hadn't heard of before. I had the veal chop special which was served with two large and yummy prawns. I wish I had been asked how I liked my veal as it served well done and I prefer more medium rare. For dessert, I had tiramisu which was excellent. \n\nMy problem with this restaurant was the service. Our server was friendly at the beginning but we had a couple of problems. My grandfather is a 93 year old man that can't hear well and can't speak all that clearly. The server misunderstood what he ordered and when utensils were brought out for the food, it was clear there had been a mistake. Instead of apologizing for it, the server got defensive and said that she had repeated the order and no one corrected it. She went back to the kitchen and corrected it, then came out and asked him if he was ok with that. He said of course, because it's what he ordered and she said yes, you better be ok with that. She started off quite friendly, and she ended quite friendly, but this caused some tension. \n\nMy other complaint would be the amount of time it took. From sitting down to being served food it was 45 minutes. Similarly, from ordering desserts to getting them it was about another 15 minutes. I can't comment on how busy the restaurant was because we weren't inside but this still felt lengthy to me. \n\nNot sure if we'll be back.

Happy hour is only available at the bar, but it is an amazing deal!  We had a spicy tuna roll and the rock shrimp and jalapeno roll.  Roku has the best spicy tuna of any sushi place I have ever visited.  We also had the popcorn shrimp - ask for a side of spicy mayo to make this even more delicious - and the miso eggplantt.

As requested, they gave us a table so we could see the Bellagio fountains.  Our reservation was at 9 PM and we were disappointed to find out that the chef was no longer offering the tasting menu that evening. Our waiter, however, said we could create our own tasting - excellent!  \n\nWe started with the polenta with mushrooms - delicious, but it maybe could have used a bit more salt. Next up was the infamous $24 spaghetti. Well worth it - this is the best pasta I ever ate. Since we were indulging, the next course was more pasta. The duck and foie gras ravioli. It was good, but very rich and not even close to as good as the beef cheek ravioli from Carnevino. I am not sure why people would compare the two. On carb overload we then had the lamb which was fantastic. For some reason they also sent out a duck entree which we had not ordered. Not a fan of the spices - cardamom and clove. Nor was I a fan of the waiter attempting to charge us for it. \nDessert was the chocolate salted caramel cake. Good, but nothing to rave about. \n\nWine prices are high but on par with everything else on the strip. \n\nOh, I almost forgot the bread basket and dipping sauces. The Stromboli bread with salami and cheese is phenomenal. The marscapone butter could make even cheap white bread taste good. \n\nDefinitely worth a visit to try the spaghetti. I will be going back for that!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

She went to pick up her table at the 59th Ave. and Bell location she put it in her truck and she left and never paid for.  The owners daughter on the E.

I would say in the 15 minutes before she called the police she had to have called for probably 10 times. She knew she owed the money when she loaded the table she should have paid for it then. Howie world was left with nothing left but to call the police to protect themselves. I have never seen someone in my life be so rude to people in a store as this Riki was. Howie world was not rude to her or mean to her. She wanted them to deliver something on a different day and hour before closing. And it simply could not have been done.

The portabello wrappini (hold the cheese, please) and the salad bar with their black currant tea are the keys to the good life for lunch and a mid-afternoon craving for a friggin' good sandwich. (And of course, the occasional slide on the vegan diet for a much needed fill of cheese that can only be satisfied by their french onion or tomato basil soup- yummo). \n\nA few bummers-  the lack of veggie sandwich options ( I think there are only 3 or 4), which is why I pretty much order the same thing every time. But having this in mind, I haven't been displeased going there for my mushroom wrappini. \n\nThis is a good place to take anyone because they have stuff that everyone likes (even pasta for those who don't want a sandwich- in which case you should rush them to the nearest hospital because something ain't right- who goes to a damn deli and doesn't get a sandwich?). \n\ncheers and happy sandwiching, \nthe vegan foodies\n\n(written by Tara, the Karim in Karimaford- admittedly high strung half of the vegan.foodie.team )","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

My husband and I went here for our 1st wedding anniversary. The food was absolutely perfect. The service was top notch. \nWe began with the hot rocks appetizer. The steak was thin sliced and had a marinade that was full of flavor. You cook the steak to your liking and eat. Wonderful idea.. After the appetizer, I had the wedge salad. The presentation was beautiful and the flavors were consistent and well balanced. Yum. My husband had the caesar which he enjoyed.\nWe both had the Filet Mignon medium which was cooked to perfection. The side sauces were so good and really brought out flavors of the meat. We ordered the asparagus, the mac and cheese and the garlic mashed potatoes. My favorite was the mac and cheese... Seriously, I wish I had the recipe.. They were amazing!! The asparagus was not soggy which I find is the case alot of times. They had a fire roasted flavor which I enjoyed. The garlic mashed potatoes were great also.. some of the best I've had.\nOverall I think that Brand Steakhouse is one of the best steakhouses that I've eaten at. It should be in the top five of Las Vegas... I will definitely go back.

I ordered a Noodle Soup and a Stir Fry. The noodle soup was so-so but the Stir Fry was a disappointment. This happened on Oct 25th afternoon - please refer to the attached picture of receipt. First, the chef thought it was just stir fry with no rice, and later on someone came over and put the rice back and gave the dish back to me with no apology. The Cashier was not interested in saying hello or trying to promote what's good in the restaurant. She didn't want to look at us in the eye - it's a bit rude honestly. Well, the owner smiled but that's the person who cared. \n\nBack to the Stir fry, take a look at what we got vs. what's up there on the menu board. The menu board stir fry looks a lot better - nice pieces of beef with broccoli and fresh veggie. Look at what I got! Lots of bean sprouts, which were not cooked very well. I was told it's the way they make it - it's Thai. Yes, it's true, but the bean sprouts reeks because it's not cooked well. Why? It's not fresh!!!!\n\nAnyway, I was about to complain but when I checked out the Pad Thai another customer got across from my stable. It's merely two pieces of shrimp mixed with noodles. It didn't look too good either. I was like, well, I might as well save my breath. \n\nI mean, I have been a Thai Express fan since the day it was born. I like your Mini Soups and your Noodle Soups. Once in a while I visit your restaurants, but this time, it's the huge disappointment. Your menus aren't cheap. It's comparable to a fine dining Thai restaurant and I expect something better. \n\nIf you wish to keep us as frequent customers, you have to do a better job.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I did some research online and time and again the advice I came across was to get a realtor. This then led to the next challenge: how would I choose my realtor? \n\nAnd to Yelp I went. Rebecca's name popped up near the top with great reviews stating how professional and involved she was (both very true). Upon visiting her website, I was instantly struck by how straightforward and open she seemed. Her bio is down-to-earth and includes details that make you feel comfortable and like you're about to get down to work with an old friend.\n\nTo me, she was the obvious first and only choice. I'm so glad I picked her! \n\nAfter sending her a detailed email of my situation and rental needs, she replied promptly and with positivity, reassuring me that while my situation was unique, it was hardly impossible. She set to work adding me to a database that would email me potential rentals that featured the specific things I was looking for. So awesome to be able to apartment hunt from your inbox! \n\nI did indeed find the perfect place, and I couldn't have done it without Rebecca. She made communicating with the landlords and their realtors a breeze and was able to prepare the lease and handle other details, freeing me to focus on other things associated with an international move.\n\nRebecca actually cares about her clients, and finding them the right rental or forever home is both her goal and her specialty. If you are looking to rent or buy, Rebecca should be your go-to choice.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

THIS IS THE PLACE! \n\nBecause I'm strictly a film photographer, I was looking to find a store that would offer great support in terms of my analog needs. I tried one other place in the city and was disappointed by their crappy customer service and the fact that they kept their film stock hidden away from view. \n\nNot at Downtown Camera. With a wall made of vintage cameras and a range of films right out in the open, I knew this was going to be a good fit.\n\nNot only do they have E6 outlab services, their turnaround time for film processed in-house is quick, and you can receive text or email updates to know when your film is ready. And they offer a punch card (for in-house developing only) to keep track of the film you've dropped off -\n once you've hit your ninth roll, your tenth is free! \n\nSeriously, if you are still shooting film, are only shooting film, or just getting into shooting film, this is your go-to lab and photo store! With so many places choosing to only cater to digital shooters and doing away with film processing altogether, we need to take care of the stores that are taking care of us! Make your film cameras happy, come into Downtown Camera! :)\n\n*UPDATE*\nAs I've been taking more and more advantage of the film processing services at Downtown Camera, I've become aware of a few issues that I find problematic. Thus why I've felt the need to alter my original review. First, the customer service is very touch and go. Some days I go in, and it's fantastic. Other days, it's as if the person behind the counter is going through the motions. The assistance you receive is never consistent, and that's pretty much a bummer. Second, and even more disheartening, is the fact that next day film service at Downtown Camera is now three or even four days processing time, something that seemed to have started within the past month. I inquired about it possibly being due to a large influx of film to be processed, but the person behind the counter claimed that this was the norm. Not sure how next day can be advertised as such, but I do know that there are other film processing places in TO that will develop your film either that day or the very next day, dependent on how early in the morning you drop off, and that is their regular service. Just a few things to consider when assessing your film processing needs.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I looked online and saw that this store carried Blundstone boots. The official Blundstone site even listed this shop as having the boots I wanted - #584 - in stock. \n\nAnd then I went inside. The saleswoman wasn't what I'd call warm, but coming from NYC, I can be used to brusque salespeople. She informed me that they did not have my size in that particular boot in stock, but that I could check back in September. I then asked if I could try on another pair of Blundstones just to see how they feel on your feet since I've never owned a pair. The saleslady seemed put off. She told me that they wouldn't fit the same as the winter boots. I told her, I was aware of that, but if I was in the store, I'd still like to try a pair on to see if I even like the brand, especially if I was to wait until September for the ones I want. These boots aren't cheap either, so yeah, trying any pair on can give some insight into their fit.\n\nShe actually continued to dissuade me from trying them on. Someone whose very job revolves around getting people to buy shoes. It was confusing and she came off seeming like I was putting her out by asking her to pull a box of boots from the back. \n\nI repeated again that, if I'm going to spend that much money, I want to know what I'm getting into, and would like to know how any iteration of the boots fit. She finally acquiesced and went and got me the boots.\n\nWhile all of this was going on, I felt awful. Unwelcome and unwanted. There was literally one other customer in the store with her mom. And me, being treated like I'm dumb for wanting to try on a pair of shoes.\n\nI can say that many other stores in Toronto sell Blundstone boots and I would suggest if you would like to experience being treated with respect and decency, to avoid this store. Especially as a new arrival to this city, this kind of experience leaves me feeling flummoxed and bummed out. \n\nI should point out that I proceeded to pop into five or so other shops after going into this store, and every salesperson that greeted me did so with enthusiasm and kindness and provided exemplary customer service.\n\nWe all make choices with our wallets. I personally wouldn't spend my money or my time in this store in the future, as they made it very clear that I wasn't worth theirs.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

So, I am starving I just got home from working on the strip and I work at Bar too that closes at one in the morning that is why I called to ask. My husband and I walk inside and sit right in front of the bar at one of the high tops it was 15 mins before anyone came to greet us or give us any menus. Finally, a male bartender came and greeted us he was friendly but was in a rush to get our order he just handed us the menu and asked \"Do you know what you want?\" We needed a min and did not ask if we wanted some thing to drink or nothing just \"I assumed you been here before\". Retarded how can you say that to a guest. So, he came around sooner than I thought to take our order the way it was going we asked for it to go. I ordered the chicken dinner with rice and veggies; my man got a bucket of buffalo wings with extra buffalo on the side and an order of fried cheese. Then he asks do you want a drink while you wait we both said no it is okay.( In my head you'd probably bring it when the food is ready anyway.)  So it took 30 to 45 mins for the bar food to come out; we had paid before hand too and had to go up to the bar to ask the bartender how much longer that's when he finally got the food. I guess he noticed we gave him 20% and was extremely fast and nice I walked out My husband stayed to get some ranch to go. When we get home his wings were PLAIN we hand to melt butter and mix it with franks to toss the wings in to make them buffalo. Other than that the food was good the veggies did not seem fresh if anything they are frozen or canned.

Joe was able to come clean it while we were at work we trusted him to let himself in and just do his thing he notified us once he got there and also called when he was finished. When we came home the carpet looked almost new he said that it was tuff to clean he had to bring down the scrubber, put in some special chemicals for the pet stains and odors and as for the chewed up carpet he suggested either patching it or just replacing the whole area.

I absolutely loved my time at this salon. I've never been the type to do a whole lot with my hair since its kind of a strange curl that's pretty thin. I made an appt with Nicole for a full color, hi-lites, and cut & style. I got there a little before my appt which was set for 11 and the salon was clean and absolutely adorable. Nicole came and introduced her self right at 11 and took her me to her station. She asked me what I wanted and I showed her a picture. My hair was previously dyed black and the picture was of a pretty honey brown with some hi-lites. She thoroughly explained why it really wouldn't be possible to do that color without damaging my hair and it possibly not even turning out well. She explained what might be a good alternative and I told her to go for it. She was conversational and made great conversation for the whole 3.5 hr appt. She ended up doing a full hi-lite with a toner and a cut. I absolutely LOVE how it turned out and have already received so many compliments on it. I also love the cut she did and she straightened it for me which is always a luxury since I don't do it myself. I walked out of the salon looking and feeling like a million bucks! I will definitely be going back frequently to see Nicole!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I found Classic Catering on the web and looked up their reviews on YELP, which were all excellent.  After talking with Joe on the phone, I felt confident that I had found the perfect caterer ! He immediately offered to come out to our center with his daughter Denise to discuss the layout and finalize the menu.  He was the only caterer I spoke with , to offer that!\nThis past Saturday was the event , and it was fantastic! Denise, Joe Jr, and their team did an amazing job! The set ups were gorgeous, with flowers and color coordinated linens and beautifully presented food. Our guests raved to me about the quality and selection of foods and the beautiful dessert table.  Their staff were hard working , friendly professionals, that engaged with the guests in a lovely manner.  I can't recommend them enough and am delighted to know that we have found our \"go to\" caterer for our events.

I give the show three stars:\n\nFirst star is for the opening sequence. Just prior to the show the audience is treated to some acrobatic antics, and even a comedic reminder to stow the electronics. Paired with helpful staff in costume and character helping you to your seats, and a breathtaking stage to take in sets your heart pumping for a great show. The opening scenes don't disappoint. The martial arts in the first couple scenes are amazing to watch, and soon you are treated to a boat scene that is also fun to watch. \n\nSecond star is for great acrobatics with the \"death wheel\" (you'll know it when you see it), and some more cool action sequences to close out the show. \n\nThird star is for the stage, which is a character all to itself. A massive monolithic stage that is on some sort of hydraulic mechanism that allows it to move, rotate, and lean in amazing angles further shows off the athleticism and skill of the actors as they use the stage to show a variety of talents. The stage can also be lowered completely out of site allowing for cool aerial acrobatics as well. \n\nNow for the last two stars that this show lacks. First off, you better listen carefully to the few lines of narration at the beginning of the show because that's all you'll get. While it does give the outline of the plot I still found it extremely difficult to follow the story line, and in fact there were several scenes that seemed ponderously slow and even repetitive without advancing the story in meaningful ways.  You never really understand why the enemy attacks, but they attack again and again, and normally in the same repetitive fashion. There are also two scenes, the beach and the shadow puppets, that are awkward and feel completely out of place. \n\nSecond, with the exception of the first 10-15 mins and 5-10 mins towards the end, the show's acrobatics seemed to be just \"OK\". There were \"wows\" and \"oohs\" and \"ahhs\" in each section there, but often there were only a few and sometimes featured too early in a scene and repeated then without the same wow factor. With such an impressive stage and hints in the pre show antics of ways to use the stage and even the space above the audience in amazing fashion, the show itself left me with the sense that there was so much more that could've been. \n\nAll in all I was entertained but I can't say I enjoyed it, especially in comparison to other Cirque du Soleil shows and expectations. It's worth seeing for the stage if you can get a good price, but be prepared to feel like you over invested 90 mins of time. In another city and without the CDS mystique it would probably be amazing and awe inspiring, but in a Las Vegas world where \"Too Much\" is often \"Just enough\", I felt like Ka was just a little lacking.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1}

We agreed and added a mixed green salad. \n\nThe salad was big enough for three and was very tasty. The fish and chips were delicious, the beer batter very flavorful and the fish itself was cooked to perfection. More than enough again for two of us and we still had dessert to go. \n\nThe sticky toffee pudding to close things out was amazing. Probably the best dessert we have ever tasted and again more than enough for two people to share. \n\nThis is Las Vegas and everything was pricey but for the value of the food and the experience and the absolutely amazing service from Christopher and Mehdi, this was probably the best money we have spent so far on our trip. \n\nA fantastic experience and I highly recommend it.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":2}

Amongst the ten of us, we ordered some twelve dishes, including hakka chicken and shrimp, chicken 65, chili garlic noodles with chicken, garlic pepper chicken and shrimp chop suey.\n\nThe Chicken 65 was very good, with slightly tangy pieces of boneless chicken that had a crunch on first bite, garnished with red and green bell peppers. The chili garlic noodles were tasty, but we initially thought there was a mistake with our order since we could not see any chicken in it.  On close inspection, we noticed a few miniscule pieces of chicken... The shrimp chop suey was about average, although the few shrimp were rather small. The garlic pepper chicken was neither garlicky nor peppery, instead swimming in a pool of watery gravy. But the biggest disappointment was the hakka dishes, which are a signature Indo-Chinese noodle dish.  These were completely bland, and we had to resort to adding more than a few dollops of the 6 sauces at the table to pretend we were having Indo-Chinese cuisine.\n\nWe wished the portions were more generous, like we get at most Chinese restaurants. We had to order a couple of extra entrees since some of us were still hungry, whereas we almost never can finish our food at other restaurants.\n\nThe service was competent bordering on perfunctory. One of us was curious about Nasi Goreng on the menu, but our server could not describe how it was prepared, instead steering us to a couple of other choices on the menu.\n\nOur receipt invited us to share our experience at a \"Talk2us\" link, which only produced a \"survey error.\"\n\nHaving had great Indo-Chinese food in Calcutta, Vancouver and Houston, we are still waiting for a comparable experience in the Phoenix area.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

But, at least, for me, when I arrive at place where the Wi-Fi is available I like to have access. I tried all the variations provided by the waitress and none worked. On the end, she asked me to look for one of the customers and ask him how they connect. Very bad negative point for me.\nOverall, the salad was okay. To be true, I prefer the Asian Chicken Sesame salad from Panera Bread. The dried noodle was very hard to eat and most of the salad components were cut in chunks instead of niece pieces to eat with a fork. What makes a mess while you are eating. Well... I did not get excited with the food this time. But I intend to come back here again next time that I visit Toronto, I notice other dishes on the menu that called my attention.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

No\n\nOn Thursday around 7:00pm, me and my wife went to the restaurant to have our dinner and we faced the first negative point, the parking lot. The parking lot was not enough to accommodate all the people to the restaurant because it is shared with other stores around. So, it was not hard, but it was easy to notice there was not enough space for everyone. At least, we did not need to wait so much time to sit.\n\nThe table was clean, but there was an old newspaper below my table and I noticed that the floor was not totally clean. On a first moment, I thought that the waitress service was nice, but after we placed the order, we got forgotten. My soda glass was empty for a long time and the waitress never comes back asking if I wanted more. But the rolls were delicious, unfortunately, what I cannot say about the Frango no Churrasco and the Bacalhau that me and my wife asked.\n\nOverall, it was frustrating for asking the two items that were house specialties and eat a food with poor quality. The Bacalhau was under seasoned and burned plus the potatoes were blend too. My Frango no Churrasco, the chicken was almost very good, the rice and potatoes were almost cold. It seems that the food was released for a time and they forgot there. But the worst for me was having a bad Bacalhau on a Portuguese restaurant. It is a very bad sign. I don't plan to come back again to it and if you are looking for a Portuguese restaurant, I recommend looking for other.

Walking the esplanade at the Wynn only offered me dreams of being able to walk in Chanel, Louis Vuitton, and their fine shoe store 'Shoe In' and not being alarmed at the sight of a $700 pair of heals.  It was however fun to dream.

At first when you walk in, you do notice the equipment is outdated.  But the main trainer is one of the best I've experienced.  I felt it was ideal for beginners and those who have experience training.  \n\nEvery boot camp class was different and I attended 3 a week. Different music was played each class, so it was never the same.  Each boot camp class had different exercises so I was never bored.  We worked on every aspect of exercise, core, cardio, weight training, stretching, etc.  The teacher did go back and forth from English and Spanish which I thought was considerate since both Spanish and English speaking people were attending the class.  \n\nOne of the things I noticed was since I had bought a groupon, the trainers at the gyms I attended are notified you're a groupon buyer, almost like a label, and didn't show as much attention to me as they did to others.  As a groupon buyer you're not paying full price so it can show from the place you're at they won't give you full service.  At this gym this wasn't the case.  On two different occasions I was the only one who showed up for the boot camp class and instead of him cancelling he provided 1 on 1 personal training.  He was basically working for free but trained me like a full paying customer.  \n\nBottom line he's an excellent trainer who knows his stuff and cares about everyone that walks in the door.  The gym may not be the biggest or the newest but that's nothing in comparison to receiving quality training.  And that's what you'll get at GAP fitness.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

(The ambience is in keeping with a \"grill\" and could be changed to make it a more intimate setting.). The carafe was a good deal at $19 and gave us almost four glasses of wine.

The multiple protein plate options on the menu give a nice variety.  The koobideh (spiced minced meat kabob) is so delicious here.

We first tried this place with a discount offer and it happened to be during happy hour. They were happy to honor the discount on the happy hour specials too which is something we appreciate as it shows they are not petty and that they care about customer service.  We ordered some extra stuff because of this just so they did not lose money on us. Their kindness payed off with good karma. \n    We have been back several times and had sushi rolls.  However, my husband does not like seaweed so ask the rolls to be made with soy paper instead.  They were happy to do it and did not charge anything extra for it unlike many other sushi places that will add an extra charge. Once again we really appreciate the customer service. \n     Another thing they have is a Sunday brunch all you can eat sushi offering. This is unusual in Arizona and love that they do it. Going out for sushi can often add up quick no matter were you go and for what a few rolls might cost you could do all you can eat at Kawaii during Sunday brunch.  Now they do limit the sashimi to 4 slices of each type of fish but no limit on rolls or nigiri and furthermore it includes for no additional charge some appetizers and drink options as well which makes it a nice experience.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1}

It delivers the WOW!-factor with all the Cirque-type amazing aqua-acrobatics, and keeps you entertained the whole way through. Seriously, the performers were doing twists & turns & jumps & moves I didn't even know  was humanly possible. The diving segment was my favorite. Hats off to all the amazing performers!! \n\nA little tip about the seating..... The venue is an intimate circular theater, with the circular pool in the center as it's stage. There are only 12 rows of seating, so yes, basically every seat has a great view & you really can't go wrong. The first 2 rows are considered \"splash zone\" ($105\/seat), the next 9 rows (Rows 3-11) are Premium seats ($129\/seat) and the last row (Row 12) is the VIP\/Dream seats (ranging from $155 to $195\/seat.).  I have sat in the 1st row (splash) and 5th row (premium) and can honestly say I much preferred the premium row. I'm not discouraging the splash zone seats because of the threat of getting wet.... In fact, I only got a sprinkle of water while in the first row (if even that)! The reason I suggest the premium section is because this show has SO much to see and by sitting a bit further back, you'll be able to take in more visually.  There is also a lot of the acts happening high up (way high up, from the ceiling).... and I found myself straining my neck to see all that was going on up high, whereas you could view it all at ease sans the neck strain if you were in premium:)  Also, I don't think it's worth it to get the VIP\/Dream seats.... other than it offering a super plushy comfy chair (and champagne & choco covered strawberries) , one of the perks to those seats is that it includes a video monitor in front the seat, which I heard is streaming you live feed of all the backstage and underwater action during the show, but believe me, you'll have so much to watch on stage, I don't think you want to waste your time watching the monitor ;)","useful":12,"funny":2,"cool":2}

It's moving. It's captivating. You will leave the show with a huge smile on your face, a hop & skip in your step, and you will NOT be able to stop humming all the fabulous songs in your head for days! \n\nJust a few of the HITS that will get stuck in your head: \n- Sherry\n- Can't Take My Eyes Off of You\n- Big Girls Don't Cry\n- Who Loves You\n- Oh What a Night! December 1963\n- Walk Like a Man\n- Bye Bye Baby\n- I've Got You Under My Skin\n\nQuick tidbit on seating:\nJB has been at \"Paris Theater\" since March 2012. It's a bigger stage & venue than when it was at Palazzo (where it reigned from 2008 thru 2011). Other than size, another difference is that this new theater does not have a balcony. You are either in the front half (Orchestra section), or back half (Mezzanine). When I got my tix, I was told that the last row (Row M) was only 75 feet away from the stage, implying that even the last row has a good view of the stage. I ended up getting seats in Row K (third row from the back), and they were right! You still have a great view of everything. :)\n\nI've seen JB twice, and can't wait to see it again!!!!!","useful":7,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Now you have 2 NOBU's gracing your city! Congrats to Chef Nobu Matsuhisa and his business partner, Robert DeNiro (!!) on their beautiful newest creation..... NOBU at Caesar's Palace, LV!  \n\nFirst, a few fun facts:\n- The official ribbon-cutting was on February 2, 2013 \n- Of the 29 NOBU restaurants, this is the largest location worldwide! \n- The NOBU Hotel, a \"boutique hotel\" which is next to the restaurant (both in Caeser's) is the first \"NOBU Hotel\" ever! It has 181 rooms, and even features a number of suites with up to 5 rooms. One of these days, I WILL stay here.... the pics of the rooms are gorgeous...and get this, 24-hour availability to Nobu in-room dining room service. Eeeep! ;)  \n\nNow, back to the restaurant. You are greeted with an elegant entryway filled with origami birds overhead. Just past the check-in desk, you get a full glance of the beautiful modern & trendy main dining room filled with artistic lamps that look like floating jellyfish. There is a bar and lounge in the front area, sushi bar on the left side, and then the sea of seats filling the rest of the open & spacious layout. There are a variety of different style of seats to accommodate all different sizes of parties..... small tables for the romantic couples, larger booth tables (both circular and square), and secluded tables (in nest-like booth areas) for more private larger parties. There are also secluded areas for the teppanyaki grill tables. Overall, the atmosphere is warm and inviting, which sets the tone for the amazing food you are about to indulge in.\n\nNow, onto the FOOD! Below are the dishes (mostly signature favorites) that me and the hubby had.... Each one was fabulous, and extremely satisfying....!!\n\n1) Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno - $28   (a MUST HAVE!)\nsix (heavenly!) thinly sliced pieces of yellowtail, with an even more thinly sliced piece of jalapeno on each. In a light ponzu sauce, and coupled with a piece of cilantro, this combo melts in your mouth and leaves you wanting more. This is my FAVORITE dish. I bet 99% of the people who get this are thinking \"should I order another round now or later?\" as they are finishing off this one ;) \n\n2) Black Cod w\/ Miso - $34 (a MUST HAVE!)\nSo succulent & tender....every bite of it literally melts in your mouth! Don't \"pass\" on this one, thinking once you've had a good black cod, you've had em all. NOPE! This one is amazing & you should believe all the hype about it!! The sauce is light & sweet, and I just have a STRONG feeling you will not be disappointed :) \n\n3) Kumamoto Oysters with Nobu Sauce - $18 (a MUST HAVE!)\nThis comes with 3 oysters, each topped with a different garnishing (maui onion, \"las vegas\", and jalapeno). If you have a party of 2, I strongly suggest you get 2 orders so that each person can have their \"own\" trio :) It was super fresh n delicious! \n\n4) Rock Shrimp Tempura - $24 (a MUST HAVE!)\nOK, so per our server, this signature dish usually comes with either the Creamy Spicy or Butter Ponzu sauce.....but Exec Chef Thomas Buckley (who was brought over from the Miami Beach location) decided to throw in a 3rd sauce choice... Jalapeno! We couldn't decide between the butter ponzu & Jalapeno, so our server offered to bring it out not tossed, but with the 2 sauces 'on the side'. I suggest you do this, as both sauces were amazing and I think you can savor the flavors more with dipping rather than having it mixed in. Served on a bed of micro greens which also tasted good with the sauces. \n\n5) Spicy Miso Chips with Big Eye Tuna - $16\nThis was tasty but I felt that the plum sauce was a bit too sweet and overpowering. Would have loved this if the sauce was more subtle... \n\n6) Pork Belly Miso Skewer - $14\nIf you love pork fat, this is your dish! Comes with 2 skewers of incredibly butter-like pork cubes. Tasty, but again I thought there was a lil too much sauce.  My hubby thought it was delicious though!\n\nDessert\nWe went with one of the most popular picks -- The Bento Box - $15\nFlourless chocolate cake, with white chocolate sauce, shiso syrup, and house-made green tea ice cream. Delicious and the perfect way to wrap up a wonderful dinner experience. \n\nI'm already thinking about when I can go back again. Maybe Nobu will consider his next venue in the Bay Area? SF and San Jose would love one!!!!! :oD !!","useful":20,"funny":1,"cool":11}

My only complaint was it was a bit heavy on the lime, but then again I'm just not a lime fan ;) \n- Spanish Chicken Croquetas - kinda like fried mozzarella stick, but with chicken & creamy bechamel sauce!

Also, it's probably more ideal as a sampler dish for a large party. For my table of 2, I felt like I had enough after a few bites, and felt padron pepper'd out by the time we finished the plate :op\n- Brava Potatoes - don't get me wrong, it was delicious. but as it's a pretty filling dish, i just felt that these were not out of this world, and I'd rather fill up on one of the many other tapas choices they have to offer\n\nOverall, it was so delicious.

Restaurant Groupons are something of a scam.  I get that I am supposed to tip on the full amount - I can do the math - the 'non-negotiable' automatic 15% tip on the total INCLUDING tax is ludicrous.  Given this was not disclosed in advance or on the Groupon, it's also not legal.  A gratuity is a gratuity, and I would have given my host Nasir a larger tip given the option to set my own bar.  Smart businesses know that customers are marketing vectors and correspondingly treat them well, even if they are there on a deal.  Unfortunately, O.Noir is pleased to rely on its position as a novelty experience rather than stand behind its food and service standards to drive more customers through the door.  Their prerogative I suppose, but it can't be good for repeat business.\n\nI was also charged a random $15 dollar charge 'for using a Groupon' which was not stipulated anywhere on the deal.  This is truly what made me feel cheated and left a sour taste in my mouth.  My bill was identical to what it would have been without the deal = lame.  The wait to pay for said bill post-meal was crazy - they could use a more streamlined payment system (two operational tills would be nice).\n\nThe food itself was hit or miss - drink prices weren't outlandish, though considering you're apt to knock one over, this is a good thing.  I had the steak, which was great - my girlfriend had the shrimp\/risotto, which was way oversalted and overdone to the point you could patch drywall with it.  The atmosphere is what you are here for, but even blind you can feel banquet style chairs and inordinately tight spacing with other couples\/groups.  Your other senses heighten and you end up hearing a lot of other peoples' conversations very audibly, and I happened to be seated next to the most vapid and inanely redundant human beings in existence, rendering the experience even more unpleasant.  Guests in our room almost got in a blind fistfight over somebody using an indiglo watch for a second, which was entertaining in a Jerry Springerish sense.  \n\nThat second star is for the host Nasir - he's a righteous dude.  Too bad given my experience it's unlikely myself or anyone I recommend restaurants to won't get to experience his charm.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0}

When they were a street operation, albeit a semi-legal one, it was really cool, novel - people would line up for days.  The tacos were $3 apiece, and it was a unique and fun experience. \n\nEver since they got fixed locations though, I am very unimpressed.  I have slight hearing loss and the environment in this place is not conducive to any form of conversation - the music is all rap and hip hop and seriously and intensely loud.  I don't mind the style of music at all and am happy to eat tacos to A Tribe Called Quest, but at airplane-taking-off decibel levels? I was with a group and couldn't hear a word of what was being said, made me feel stupid and isolated.  Asking for music to be turned down was disregarded - 'this is our brand' was what I got in return.  Gross.  Service was slow and weirdly pretentious given the aesthetic they are trying to cultivate.\n\nAs per the tacos - overpriced and way small.  No lies, the cod fish is a decent two bites, but the carnita, cotija and beef cheek taste very boring - like more boring than ground beef with a 99 cent taco mix packet boring.  You could eat ten of them easily and still be hungry, which sets you back over $60 - the price\/food ratio is rough and both times I left hungry, poorer, and disappointed.\n\nThe cherry on top is that this place is run by misogynists who think it is funny to make taco puns at the expense of women.  They have done this multiple times, and I am certain will continue to do so despite overtures to the public.  But hey, it's just locker room talk, right? \n\nOn food quality, ambiance, and price, there are many, many better options for tacos in Toronto - I would skip this one.","useful":7,"funny":0,"cool":0}

If you look behind you at the rest of the restaurant, it's cute. Decor taking cues from the viceroy hotel for sure. Hipster black and yellow, life size horse lamp.\n  I ordered a cocktail, the club soda was flat. I also ordered the Cobb salad. Errrrr, it's hard to mess up a cobb salad. I was excited to see \"5 minute egg\" as one of the ingredients as I love a beautiful yolk, but it came out on a square of iceberg lettuce. This is only okay if you've ordered a wedge salad and they disguise this cheap lettuce by drenching it in blue cheese. I cut into the egg... lovely. So, why is my salad sort of watery? Like maybe they rinsed the lettuce and didn't spin it? The whole thing has a slimy feel.  Plus an excessive amounts of pickled onions, which I'm a fan of generally. I'm about to order something else cause I can't choke this down....wish me luck. \n  Ordered the tartare. Interesting and pretty good. Pickled mushrooms and mushrooms crisps on top (yum) but half way through,  there was so much mustard, I got queesy.\n  Staff was lovely, it was absolutely freezing, I left.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1}

I had been emailing Tom at Friendly Computers and told him exactly what was wrong with my hard drive and what Geek Squad and other techs had told me (that it would have to go to a clean room in order to recover my data).  Being desperate because all of my 2 year old's baby pictures and videos are on that hard drive, Tom gave me hope (false hope) so I took it in to him.  He told me he was 60-70% confident that he would be able to retrieve my data.  I had to pay $169 flat rate fee and leave the hard drive with them possibly for a couple of week.  About 5 days later he calls me and he tells me that he can't get any of my data.   He offers to send it to their clean room lab for an evaluation but the $169 that I already paid them was not gonna be refunded to me.  I told him I paid $169 for nothing and he said well it wasn't for nothing because we've been working on it and trying.  This sounds to be like a great way to scam people.  Tell them you think you can help them and get them to pay the $169 all the while knowing that you can't get any of that data but you sure got their money.  Wonder how many others are out there that have been thru the same situation.  Also, I have read this sales agreement\/receipt 3 times and don't see where it says the fee is non refundable even if they can't retrieve your data.  Maybe I'm overlooking it but I don't see it.  DO NOT GO TO FRIENDLY COMPUTERS.  They are not \"friendly\".  They are major con artists, scammers, liars, etc.  Don't waste your time or money and don't get your hopes up.  I got my hard drive back from him minus my $169 that was wasted down the drain and he probably erased all my data so that no one else would be able to recover it since I refused to let him send it to his lab.  I will never be able to recover those videos now of my toddlers first roll over, first crawl, first word, first steps, etc..

That was not the case here.  I would say that our room was a step up from the Motel 6 down the street. \n\nWe were placed in one of the Bungalow rooms, which is essentially, the older section of rooms.  It has three floors with one side facing the pool and the other facing a loading dock and the Tropicana roof.  If you are lucking enough like us on our anniversary, there will also be a roof access door that is cracked open about 20 feet from your window so any Tropicana employees that happen to walk through that door will have a clear view into the room.  No luck in switching rooms either.\n\nThe carpet, furniture, and mustard yellow wall paper made it feel dated, along with the cracks in the ceiling.  The only updates in the room that I could tell was a 42-inch flatscreen TV and the shower.  \n\nThe lobby looks nice and updated, but the casino itself is pretty small.  We ended up spending most our time elsewhere.  Pool look decent, but was crowded.  Half of the area was empty as it was reserved for 'special' guests.  \n\nIf I were to do it all over again, I would have saved the extra cash spent on this supposed 4-star hotel and booked at one of the other 3 star casinos nearby that have better rooms, bigger casinos, and better location.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0}

Parents are encouraged to give feedback and suggestions and they are very responsive to parents' inputs.  The weekly newsletter also allows us to know what my little one has been learning so that we can reinforce some of the things at home (ex. songs or books that they have been learning).\n\nKids and Company really is as good as it gets in terms of daycare :)","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

For example, when we asked about what fish they were using for the ceviche, she told us that they were only serving sea bream -- then told the other table that they had the option between sea bream or red snapper.  \n\nFor every table she went to, she'd ask if they wanted to order anything else, then if the customers said 'no', she'd roll her eyes as she walked away.

My initial impression was great because they seemed to be so kind and caring towards our kiddos.  However, from a business perspective they are terrible.  They are very difficult to get a hold of, whether if it's to make an appointment or ask a question.  We had an appointment and when I called earlier in the week to confirm the time, I did not get a response.  The morning of the appointment I reached out again to ask how much time they'd need for our dogs because we had a potential conflict and had to leave the house 3 hours out from what I was guessing was our scheduled time.  I thought maybe we could do 2 of 3 dogs, but wasn't sure if we could get all 3 done.   When I did get a response back, it was a text saying they were cancelling our appointment entirely.  No call to answer my initial question of how long they'd need or a discussion to figure out an alternative solution (I could have easily had my mother come to the house).  Then Mitch went on to say that they might not be the best service for us because they prefer customers that have recurring appointments and they were raising prices.  A...they never discussed a desire to have recurring appointments, which we'd be happy to do if we were aware it's a requirement and B...there had been no discussion about a change in pricing.  Instead they cancelled on us within hours of our appointment and implied I was lucky they weren't going to charge me a cancellation fee.  Then I find out they decided to groom other dogs that were in the neighboring house they were at that morning. This was ridiculous.  Clearly it was more convenient for them to take this other client and cancel on us, but this is poor business.  It has taken us weeks to get scheduled with another mobile groomer to take care of our dogs (which I have found to be much more professional).  I would not recommend this service due to poor communication and business practices.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Here's the story...........  I bought a 2009 Maxima from them in December.  I got what I wanted, traded my truck that was falling apart for a newer, nicer used car from Horne Kia.  I went in there with a loan from my bank already approved so I didn't need their financing.  I went in there with the loan approval number and was happy when they told me everything was good and they would get the information about my new car to the bank so they could complete the loan.  They didn't.  They opened a new loan with my bank so that they could make some money off the new loan that they started.  Now, this normally wouldn't be that big of a deal, aside from it causing my credit to be run again, but they lied about it to me, which is unacceptable.\n\nSo, with the purchase of my new, used car, I get a free oil change when it's due.  This brings me to this last Saturday, when I brought it in for it's first oil change.  I made an appointment for 9:30AM on Saturday to do a basic oil change.  My wife and I drop it off and they tell us it will take and hour and a half to an hour and 45 minutes.  No problem since they seemed rather busy, we'll go get some breakfast.  So it's after 12:30 and still no call, I figure they may have forgotten to call us and we just head back there since it's been three hours.  Much our dismay, we get there and it's still in the same spot it was in when we left.  I go into the office, which is now virtually empty, and speak with the service advisor I dealt with earlier.  He tells me that they had to go get an oil filter from a parts store since it was a Nissan they were working on and they were a Kia dealership.  Well, that makes sense if I hadn't made an appointment 8 days earlier and they weren't expecting me.  But here's the real kicker; a 2009 Maxima takes the exact same oil filter as virtually every Kia from 2008 and before, as well as some 2010 Kia's.\n\nApparently this service advisor thought I wouldn't know this, as most people wouldn't, I'm sure.  When I asked him again what part it was they had to go get from a parts store, giving him the chance to be honest with me, he lied again.  Therefore, I presented him with this information and he instantly turned quite sheepish, not knowing what to say.  I proceeded to tell him that all we wanted was some honesty and they obviously don't deliver that at this dealership.  My wife and I walked away and he had nothing to say.\n\nCase and point: NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE.","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":0}

First fyi: the company charges 80 dollars an hour (for two movers).  There is a minimum 2 hour block to use the services.  And there is a one hour \"driving\" fee of 80 dollars to initially get to your place.  So, the very minimum the service will cost is 240 dollars.  Seemed pretty reasonable.\n\nI hired All My Sons to move the furniture from a one bedroom apartment to a different unit in the same complex.  The new apartment was about 100 ft away from the first so there was no real \"driving time\" involved during the actual move.  All I really needed moved was a dining table, desk, bed, dresser, small file cabinet, and nightstand.  Shouldn't take more than 2 hours, right?  Wrong.  The workers moved slower than tar and continually used my bathroom and drank all my bottled water.  4 hours later, I just asked them to stop and said that I would pay what I owed.  Over 500 dollars later, I was still left with a ton of stuff to move on my own.  Also, they taped shut my dresser drawers and file cabinet doors with a tape they assured me would not damage the paint.  And when I started peeling the tape away, half of the paint came off with it.  They do not take of belongings and they scratched up the entire surface of my 1 month old white desk to the point I had to paint the entire thing over in a dark color.\n\nIf you're in need of trustworthy movers, try to use bekins or another more well established company.

However, people usually go for their cold noodles. They also feature an extensive list of Sundae (\"soon-deh\") dishes, which is Korean sausage made with pig organs and intestines. Observing the other tables, I noted that it wasn't as popular as Naeng Myeon. However, keep in mind that it was a hot summer evening and the cold noodles are just that good. I personally like Sundae (spelling it like that is making me want ice cream...argh. I better switch to Soondae), and encourage you to try it!\n\nChik Bibim Naeng Myeon (Thin arrowroot noodles with a special sauce)\nWin!\nThis was perfect for the hot day. The slushy broth, cooling veggies, chilled arrowroot noodles, and sliced hard-boiled egg made this the most satisfying bowl of noodles that I've had in Toronto. I chowed until all that was left was a puddle of the \"special spicy sauce\" which I loved. From what I observed, it's essentially hot pepper paste (gochu-jang), hot pepper flakes, and probably a bit of soy & minced garlic.\nThe slurried broth kept the dish chilled while I ate through my mother's plate of Tang Soo Yuk. My father and I shared dumplings & short ribs.\nAnyways, I can quite honestly say that this was the best bowl of cold noodles that I've had to date, rivalling South Korea. While it may seem backwards to eat spicy food when it's hot, it was super satisfying and it didn't make me feel hotter at all.\nNot a fan of spicy food? They offer Mul Naeng Myeon, which is essentially the same thing but without the spicy sauce (but that's what makes this so good, so please...get the bibim!!). It comes with seasonal fruit - watermelon was being served tonight. I like watermelon, but I love spice.\nI also like squirting hot mustard all over my noodles. You can also add vinegar, but I don't like it in my Naeng Myeon.\n\nTang Soo Yuk (Korean-style Chinese dish. Sweet & Sour Pork)\nSoggy :(\nA childhood favourite of mine, this is an example of Korean-style Chinese cuisine. There are many dishes that you'll find in Korean restaurant under this niche - Jajamyeon (black bean noodles) is another popular example. Sticky-sweet, when it's done right the deep-fried pork, chicken, or beef has super crispy batter and is tender on the inside with a generous helping of sugary syrup, vegetables and fruit. Unfortunately, this was not done right. It was squishy, not crispy, which pretty much ruined the dish. Boo.\n\nKalbi (Grilled, marinated beef short ribs)\nSkip this...\nI've had better - much better. I am a bit of snob since I often make my own short ribs, but since I don't have a grill I like ordering them from restaurants. The cut of meat tasted low grade and fatty, and the flavour was lacking from the missing green onions. Moving on.\n\nMandu (dumplings Available fried or steamed)\nDeep fried goodness!\nAnother dish that I often make on my own, I still like to order these in restaurants since I never deep-fry them at home. I was pleased with these, and I would order them again with my noodles over the kalbi any day!\n\nI was a little frustrated with the service, but it was super-busy so I wasn't upset. The servers were rushing between tables, so they definitely weren't slacking. I was simply anxious to get my banchan because I was super hungry and jealously watching other tables get theirs while we were a little forgotten...even though we were right in front of the kitchen. Oddly, we received our mandu (dumplings) and kalbi (short ribs) before our banchan but again, they were under quite a bit of pressure so I didn't complain. We were also not given a box of cutlery, and it was hard to wave a server down. Needing something to eat the food on our table, I leaned over and swiped a box from another table.\n\nCho Sun Ok!","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":3}

Held on the last Sunday of every month, it has a different atmosphere than some of the more widely advertised festivals.\n\nI love wandering the streets as I shop at the various markets and try different treats. An extra Pedestrian Sunday was held on the 7th anniversary of the '03 Blackout - what a great way to thank a few overgrown Ohio trees for a spike in pregnancies (\"blackout babies\"), intense street-partying and raw sewage pouring into the Rideau Canal!\n\nAlthough my major draw was The Bellevue's fish tacos (which was a fail since they didn't end up serving them the day that I went), I stuck around and did what I do best: explore and eat. \n\nSeveral restaurants were offering street-eats, both from their regular menu and PS-treats. Here's a run-down of what we tried:\n\nSegovia\nPatacone\nPlatanos with pulled pork and sauce\nEmpanadas\nStuffed Pobleno\n\n\nEl Gordo\nBurrito Empanada\nChurros\n\n\nFresco's Cuisine Inc. Fish & Chips\nKabobs\n\n\nOther vendors were selling Indian cuisine, pastries, jewellery, and sandwiches. As we munched away, we wandered the streets and enjoyed the fun vibe. In the spirit of Pedestrian Sunday, some locals were playing music and there were children selling some fun treats.\n\nAn oyster-loving friend was happy to discover these on sale outside of New Seaway Fish Market. Shucked to order, there were 4 varieties: French Kiss, Lucky Lime (PEI), and Kumamoto (2 for $5) as well as a BC variety (3 for $5).","useful":7,"funny":2,"cool":4}

The spiced chutney was a pleasant start to the meal while my friend and I waited for the rest of our party to arrive. \n\nTom Collins Cucumber Gazpacho\nLake Erie farms cucumber, lemon cress, preserved lemon, Canadian gin \nI enjoyed this version quite a bit. Never having tried a non-tomato gazpacho before, this was my first pick for lunch. I was very pleased with the light, refreshing flavour and great consistency. Unlike Biff's gazpacho, it was neither too creamy nor smooth. I prefer it with texture, and this one definitely rivals Boulevard Cafe's tomato-based gazpacho. I did not notice the gin, which is a good thing since I'm not a fan and I'd have to do a blind taste test to see if it made a difference. This was my favourite starter.\n\nSmoked Black Cod Brandade\nCrispy shallot rings, smoked paprika essence, confit garlic crostini\nThe crispy shallot rings were great with the paprika essence topped with a generous helping of the brandade. The texture was similar to very thick mashed potatoes, and the cod flavour was not too strong. This was the overall favourite appetizer of the table (but not mine!)\n\nShaved Fennel & Purple Basil Cress Salad\nSpiced pistachio, taggiashi olive dust, orange gelée\nI enjoyed this salad - the fennel had a good bite, the pistachios were great, and I enjoyed the orange gelée quite a bit. The gelée was sweet with a firm texture, which paired well with the vegetables.\n\nLake Erie Pickerel \nWild rice coriander salad, Millbank green peas, marjoram cress, earth chardonnay vinaigrette\nIn spite of my typical hesitation to order fish, I have tried it at all of my Summerlicious outings this year. I was very glad that I did not miss out on this dish! The pickerel was cooked with the skin, which was nice and crispy and the wild rice salad was wonderful. The fish was seared very well, and was neither dry nor oily and was my favourite entree. I would order the fish at Globe Bistro again based on this!\n \nSwiss Chard Torte Verde\nBest Baa Farm feta, charred tomato coulis, blonde frisée, chives\nThe warm, baked feta on top of tomato coulis was quite savoury without an overpowering feta flavour. The tomato coulis had a cheesy taste and thick texture - I personally would have preferred a stronger charred tomato flavour instead but it was a great sauce to swirl the torte around before each bite.\n\nSeared Cumbrae's Flank Steak\nDuck fat Yukon chips, vine ripe tomato, scallion, Triple Crunch aioli\nCarefully cooked, the steak was wonderfully pink and juicy. The aioli was a great accompaniment and steak's usual partner in crime - the fries - were quite tasty. Thickly cut and cooked in duck fat, they were enjoyed with each tender slice of steak. This was the overall favourite.\n\nCallebaut Dark Chocolate Torte\nEspresso mousse, Cherry Lane Farms black cherry sugar\nTorte, torte, torte! Topped with mousse, this thick treat was a nice way to end the meal. I liked the torte at Biff's  a bit more, as it was a more moist and was served with a fruity sauce but this was a nice, satisfying variation as well. I love the density of torte, and the flavour of dark chocolate is something that I'll never tire of. I wasn't a huge fan of the espresso mousse - while good, I would prefer something a little sweeter\/fruity\/saucy for this dense dessert.\n\nGlobe Summer Berry \"Mess\"\nVanilla spiced meringue, bacon infused whiskey, Ontario berries\nYum! I'm not usually a fan of meringue or  vanilla but this dessert was light and pleasant. The meringue was airy and sweet, and a great combination with the Ontario strawberries. The stiff peaks were lightly browned and the vanilla flavour was very pleasant with the sweet berries. \n\nEwenity Crème Fraiche Panna Cotta \nCandied lemon zest, wild blueberry soup\nThis is the first panna cotta that I've enjoyed at a Summerlicious meal. I usually find it too creamy in taste, however joined with the blueberry soup and candied lemon this was great. I particularly enjoyed the lemon zest! The blueberry soup was akin to syrup and I'll admit that I took some torte and gave it a good swirl - it was fantastic. \n\nOverall, I was very pleased with my experience at Globe Bistro - definitely a nice way to end this year's Summerlicious escapades. Great service, good food made with local ingredients, and wonderful decor - a surefire recipe for a nice lunch or dinner. A pleasant bistro to go with friends or clients and it has a rooftop patio!\n\nPics: http:\/\/cookiesandtomatoes.blogspot.com\/2010\/07\/summerlicious-2010-globe-bistro.html","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

It wasn't put in the deep fryer for too long, so it wasn't especially crispy and the batter was so-so. I personally would have liked a bit more spice. It was okay, but I've had better value from Mezes in Greektown. The *best* calamari I've ever tried was from Yoso's-Call Joso's in Yorkville - pricey, but spiced and fried to perfection. Would not order calamari from Wish again.\n \nRomaine Salad w Cherry Tomatoes, Herb Dressing, Feta Cheese, & Crostini  \nThe waitress made a strong recommendation for the salad - she raved that she loved it and it is really great starter. Really? I think the picture speaks for itself. Romaine lettuce, a couple cherry tomatoes and an unmemorable dressing. Very poor value at $9.\n \nLamb Burger with Tomato Tzatziki & Feta\nThe saving grace of our lunch - the lamb was nicely ground and mixed with a good dash of cumin. Tender and juicy, I savoured it to make up for the disappointing salad and so-so calamari. The bun was a typical white hamburger-type of bun - too bad, really. I think that a great bun on a good burger makes a world of difference. The fries were decent - nice, thin, a little on the softer side (like the calamari! Perhaps this is just their style)\n\nThe patio and interior are simple and great for a summer brunch or lunch. Fresh, sunny flowers at each table, simple decor, and comfy couches created a low-key, relaxed atmosphere.

The mangoes were ripe, but still had enough bite so you can get a good stab with your fork each time. The balance between fruit and vegetables was great - too much red onion can kill a mango salad.\n\n\nFish Cakes\nDeep-fried ground white fish mixed with chili and long bean\nWhat a pleasant surprise - when I heard \"fish cakes\" I was expecting spongy slivers of processed fish.

I ended up scooping leftovers on some rice, yum!\n\nChicken Satay\n4 skewers of marinated chicken served with cucumber salad\nTender, juicy chicken with a sweet & salty flavour - I wish these were sold on the street. They'd be the perfect snack! A simple yet winning appetizer.\n\nThe servers were very friendly. The food came quick throughout the night, and upon request they gave us a jug of water to save the waitress the hassle of constantly refilling our glasses. We did not realize that they closed at 10pm, but they did not rush us out of the restaurant and did not seem annoyed that we were unknowingly staying well past their closing time.\n \nAuthentic Pad Thai\nThai rice noodles stir fried with sweet & sour tamarind sauce, chicken, shrimp, root vegetable, bean sprouts, tofu, coconut sauce, wrapped in a fried egg crepe\nWhat a difference from ketchup-based pad thai! Tamarind is by far the superior sauce. While ketchup (or \"sweet and sour tomato sauce\" as some restaurants call it) is very sugary, tamarind gave it a more tangy flavour and the portion in the egg crepe was quite generous. It wasn't sopping with sauce, and there meat, noodle, and sprouts ratio was great, and everything was cooked quite nicely\n\nDuck Curry\nRoasted duck in curry, lychee, bamboo shoots, peppers, and basil\nFull of bell peppers, broccoli and bamboo shoots, this aromatic curry was deliciously packed with flavour and roasted duck. To be honest, I didn't notice lychee...probably because I was too busy wolfing everything down!The curry was wonderfully seasoned; sweet, comforting and the favourite dish of the night for our table.\n\nPeanut Chicken\nChicken stir-fried with peanut sauce & long bean\nThe simple peanut chicken dish was very flavourful with moist bites of chicken. As expected, it had a very strong peanut taste, but wasn't at all pasty in texture. While yummy on a summer night, I can really see myself enjoying a bowl in the winter - and Pi-Tom's does delivery!\n\nPlamuek Pad Prik (Spicy Squid)\nSquid in hot pepper sauce with bamboo shoots and basil sauce\nA generous offering of vegetables and squid, this plate disappeared quickly! Green beans, carrots, bamboo shoots, onions, and squid, all smothered and cooked in an addictive basil sauce. Even when the food was gone, we were spooning the sauce on rice until the plate was super clean!\n\nGoong Pong Ka-Ree (Stir Fried Shrimp Dinner Special)\nStir-fried shrimp with curry powder, egg, onion, chili garlic sauce, sweet peppers.  Served with pineapple fried rice and pineapple salad.\nAnother favourite of the table - although the pineapples were canned, the salad was nice to scoop up with the shrimp and rice. The fried rice wasn't greasy (something that I'm usually wary of), and the shrimp had a great kick that kept us going back for more. \n\nBy the end of the night, all of us left happy & satisfied. Every single dish was full of flavour, the service was pleasant, and the patio was welcoming. A surprisingly delicious find, just off of Yonge Street and I will be back to try their soups and sticky-rice dessert!\n\n*Update*\nPi-Tom's Mango Sticky Rice  (~$6)\nThumbs down. I suppose I can't fault them for the blah mango - peak season has come and gone. \nMango Sticky Rice is supposed to be salty & sweet...I would've liked a bit more of a salty flavour in the coconut-milk. I could be wrong, but perhaps the rice wasn't soaked enough in the coconut-milk or maybe there wasn't enough (to my liking anyways. I'm no Thai-dessert expert) because I would've liked a milkier consistency.","useful":8,"funny":0,"cool":2}

Also ordered were the honeydew-avocado-banana and a lemonade made with crushed mint leaves and sugar cane. ($4)\n\nI liked them all - the lemonade was the most refreshing for the hot day, but I enjoyed the banana-chocolate- jalpeno flavour the most. With a consistency that's more shake-y than juice-y (makes sense given the ingredients), I enjoyed a jalapeño \"bite\" after each chocolately slurp. I wish they used a darker chocolate instead though - I think that the stronger cacao taste would go really well with the jalapeño.\n\nThe honeydew-avocado-banana was light, sweet and also on the thicker side. Next time, I think I will ask for some ice cubes in my drink even though it will dilute it a bit more just to keep it cold.\n\nThe Squirrel ($10)\nPeanut butter, sardines, hot chili sauce, cucumber, sprouts and white cheddar on dark rye\nHow could I not order this? The combination of salty, buttery, cheesy, and spicy was pretty darn good. I just wish there was more! At $10 though, it's not bad considering the big bowl of soup that came with it.\n\nI'd love to try this with a few slices of tomato and avocado. My friend disagrees saying that it's just make it too soggy but I think it'd be great. I think I will request that addition next time, if possible. I like tomatoes on everything though...\n\nThe Beach ($10)\nChick pea salad, roasted coconut, yakinori, sesame, sprouts, and cheddar on dark rye\nNot bad, a decent healthy sandwich. The chickpeas were chickpeas, the sprouts were sprouts - I got exactly what I ordered. While tasty, I won't be craving it anytime soon and I'd sooner try something else off of their menu.\n\nThe Fish Fry ($14)\nGolden fried Ontario Rainbow Trout, with a dandelion & avocado mixed green salad, white vinaigrette.\nThe Rainbow Trout was well done, although I wish there was more to the salad. I wonder how much it would have cost to upgrade to the Greens with Envy salad? Purple kale, dandelion, cucumber, green onion, sprouts, and broccoli sounds pretty darn good.\n\nThe following two items come with sandwiches, or you can order them separately.\nSoupe de Soleil ($4)\nThe butternut squash and was thick, filling, and satisfying. I actually like my squash soups a bit chunky so I was quite happy with this homey bowl. There was also a bit of tomato & scallions and possibly carrot, if I recall correctly. Yum.\n\nBlack Beans ($6)\nThe black bean dip with avocado was also tasty with the red tortilla chips. Dense and chunky, the bowl was spooned clean. I wished there were a few more large chips in the pile, but no biggie - I just scooped some dip with my spoon with the little chip bits. In hindsight, I think I would've liked this in the sandwich too!\n\nJulies' Pies!\nOoh...pie. With Wanda's Pie in the Sky down the street I was surprised to see \"Julies' Pie\" for dessert. I racked my poor memory for a bakery named Julie's and drawing a blank, I asked where\/who Julie('s) is. It turns out that one of the owner's (Ryan) cousin's wife bakes yummy desserts for their cafe. Talk about family love :) It was a sweltering hot day, but he convinced me that the pie was \"reaaaalllly good\" with a knowing \"omg\" look on his face. Not that my sweet tooth ever needs much convincing anyways.\n\nAnd \"reaaaallly good\" it was! Totally catering to my not-so-secret love affair with Ontario peaches, the filling was just the right amount of sweet and the crust (which I think is just as important!) was nice and soft. While my friend said he would've preferred more of a \"bite\" for both the peaches and the crust, I was quite satisfied as I liked the super-soft pieces of fruit. Mmmm. It wasn't syrupy or overloaded with sugar. This pie-lover was satisfied.\n\nThe service from co-owner Chris was very friendly and conversational. I heard they were going to offer fish tacos at yesterday's Pedestrian Sundays however a combination of a precarious weather forecast and something about the cousin who was going to cook 'em up made it a no-go. I must have looked crest-fallen as I got a consoling tap on the shoulder from Ryan (is it creepy that I'm using their first names as if I know them?) and a promise of their appearance on August 29th's Pedestrian Sunday. Sadly I will be out of town, but as a fanatic of Little Italy's Fish Store, at least I know where to get my fish-fix. Pout.\n\nOverall, I had a good time at The Bellevue. While there were some things that I would like to tweak, everything tasted good and homey. The items are things that I could easily make at home, but the creative combinations certainly stirred my imagination. It won't be long before I start making my own Sardine-Nut Butter-Rye sandwiches...which may or may not be pleasant for The Bellevue to hear!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

A great barbecue joint beside a Mr. Sub and Funky Thai 2 Go? In Oakville? Hmm.\n\nBrightly lit and very clean, the interior looked newly renovated and ready for some hungry paddlers. We grabbed a table and were promptly given menus, which we scoured for the meatiest, tastiest sounding dishes. Paddling 20km during a 3 hour torrential downpour makes you hungry.\n\nSweet Smoke is both family-friendly and a good hang out, and the owner and the waitresses provided great service. After dinner, the owner was quite chatty and talked about how he slow cooked his pork and what he thought of his competition. It was a very relaxed atmosphere for a casual Saturday night dinner. They also serve homemade iced tea - sweetened, brewed tea which I found better than the bottled variety. \n\nGrilled Portobello Mushroom Melt\nArugula, Oven Dried Tomatoes, Grilled Red Onions, Gruyère Cheese, Guajillo Aioli on Toasted Rosemary Focaccia\nA generous helping of portobello paired extremely well with the gruyère. This is the same cheese that Biff's used for their crepes, and I must say that I am a fan! Although I'm not usually a fan of cheesy sandwiches, gruyère pairs very well with meat and vegetables, this sandwich being no exception. I especially enjoyed the toasted focaccia bread. Warm, \"meaty\" with mushrooms, and toasty - this was my second favourite sandwich!\n\nSouthwestern Club\nHickory Smoked Turkey, Crispy Pancetta, Tomato, Greens, Avocado and Chipotle Mayonnaise on Ciabatta\nWe were surprised to receive this sandwich, because we only inquired about it but didn't actually order it (whoops). It didn't matter - we were so hungry that it was a welcome appearance so there was no need to complain or send it back. The smoked turkey was nice and juicy, the ciabatta was was buttered and grilled. I would have liked a bit more pancetta for additional flavour. Decent sandwich, but the mushroom melt definitely eclipsed this sandwich. Even though it was my least favourite sandwich of the night, it was still tasty!\n\nEl Cubano \nPulled Pork, Shaved Smoked Turkey, Manchego Cheese and Quick Pickles on Sesame Seed Bun\nY-U-M! This was the best sandwich of the night. Smokey turkey, tender pulled pork, tangy sauce, and pickles was a great combination. Although it would probably be considered \"nontraditional\" for a pulled pork sandwich, I would have preferred it with the rosemary focaccia bread from the portobello mushroom melt and melted cheese. I liked the quick pickles quite a bit, I wouldn't mind ordering a side of them the next time I go in. The toasted sesame seed bun was soft & good, but wish it was a little more toasted - but the combination of the pulled pork and the turkey was heavenly so no complaints! Sammy win!\n\nFlat Iron Steak Burrito \nDrunken Beans, Queso Fresco, Ancho Chile Salsa and Cilantro\nUnable to find a great steak burrito in Toronto (tried Burrito Boyz, Burro Burrito, Big Fat Burrito and Burrito Loco) I felt like I was taking a chance ordering this. It came tender, juicy, and oh-so-delicious with melted cheese and great salsa. It was a good simple burrito, the meat was very well cooked - I wish it was jammed a bit more with veggies but considering that I wasn't at a burrito joint I can't expect to get a fat burrito. I wish there was a fast food burrito as tender as this...\n\nMixed Barbecue Sampler\nHickory Smoked BBQ Ribs, Slow Smoked Pulled Pork, Cowboy Beans, and Jicama slaw\nI came for the pulled pork, but when I spotted an item that gave you pulled pork and ribs, I was sold! The pulled pork was great - tender, juicy, smokey, and full of flavour. Everything I look for in pulled pork. While some might be turned off by the orange-coloured sauce, I happened to love the citrus flavour. If I could tweak one little thing, it would be the hickory flavour - more please!\nThe ribs however, were a little on the dry side but they still had a nice smokey flavour that I enjoyed. They weren't too dry, but I've had better.\nThe beans were tasty and saucy but the slaw was just slaw - I later learned that many people top their sandwiches with the slaw. I would've tried it if it occurred to me!\n\nCake and Shake!\nBlackout Cake with Dark Chocolate Pudding, and Vanilla Bean Milkshake\nThe chocolate fiend in me was definitely satisfied with this rich, moist cake. Creamy chocolate mousse layers nestled between dense cake was a great way to end the meal. If you like frothy and richly-flavoured milk shakes, you will love this. Mmm...\n\nIf you're looking for a savoury sandwich, Oakville's Sweet Smoke Barbecue & Grill is worth a visit! Friendly service (although we did accidentally get a sandwich that we didn't order), warm meaty sandwiches, and a bright interior made this a great place to grab a bite.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":2}

Rec this place for lunch\n \nTried:\nEggs Charlotte ($11.50)\nInsomnia's hollandaise sauce has a bit of a cheesy flavour. It adds a bright colour and if you like a bit of cheese, then you'll probably prefer Insomnia's hollandaise over some other breakfast joints. The eggs were well poached - not as perfectly as Hoof Cafe's but still nice and runny and the side of greens was good to nosh on between bites.\n\nEggs Manami ($10)\nOrdered off of their \"Brunch Features\" menu, the Eggs Manami had wonderful curried rice patties. This is a delicious alternative to English muffins, and I recommend this over their regular Eggs Benny.!\n\nHome Fries\nTheir home fries are great! The potatoes are freshly tossed in a bbq-y sauce, and they're not at all soggy. These were quickly snarfed and definitely worth adding to your order if they don't come with it anyways.\n\nFrench Toast\nHeaven on Earth ($10.50)\nYummy - It was crispy and filling with a generous amount of fruit. The cream cheese was good, but I would've enjoyed it just as much without. I'm not so sure that the strawberries were wild as advertised, but they were fresh! This was great drenched in maple syrup.\n\nBaked Pancakes ($10)\nSo these aren't so much pancakes as cakes-baked-in-a-pan. They are huge and are made to order and from scratch. They are very thick and dense, and take at least 20 minutes upon ordering to arrive. We were definitely stuffed after polishing these off!\n \nChocolate Banana Pancakes & Apple Cinnamon Pancakes\nWhile good, I don't think I'd order it for myself but as a post-breakfast treat to share with a larger group.\n\nOverall, Insomnia is a bright cheery breakfast joint in the Annex. I recommend it if you're looking for a tasty brunch at a great value. Their pleasant service, bright dining and bar areas, and great brunch options make it a great choice. Definitely a step up from other local breakfast joints that I've tried with respect to service, atmosphere and quality of food. Get the home fries and their egg dishes are quite tasty.\n\nI've also been there for dinner. If you go, you *must* try their Climax Cake. It's as good as the name suggests ;). Flourless chocolate torte, wonderfully dense and rich - I would return just for that dessert alone! Their pizzas are also quite good and named after Toronto neighbourhoods - I tried their Annex pizza. Their Mediterranean Platter and fries with aioli are decent appetizers to share with the table - but the pizza would be better.\n\nErin\nhttp:\/\/cookiesandtomatoes.blogspot.com\/","useful":5,"funny":3,"cool":4}

Every dish was fantastic, and the duck was crispy, non-fatty, and flavourful.\nKnowing that it takes 20-30 minutes for the food to be prepared, we ordered one of their House Specials to tide us over as well as some white rice.\n\nSzechwan Shredded Beef ($10.95\n)Crispy yet tender, crunchy but not oily, this was the perfect dish to ease our hunger pangs while we waited for the duck. I was really pleased with the beef; it had great flavour from the chili and it wasn't drenched in sauce so it stayed crispy. Shredded carrots and green onions added to the flavour, and it was great with rice.\n\nAuthentic Beijing Roast Duck (3 Courses) ($37.95)\n1. Crispy Duck Skin & Breast\n2. Duck Stir Fry\n3. Duck Soup\n\nCourse 1: Crispy, Roasted Skin\nI could hardly contain my excitement when the first course arrived. The dark skin was shining and crispy-looking, with duck breast peeking out from underneath.The flavour was fantastic. There was also little to no fat hiding between the skin and breast, which but they've rendered it so well that it was still moist.\nWith it came steamed dry crepes to wrap the roasted duck, vegetables, tian mian jian (a savoury-sweet bean sauce), and crispy shrimp crackers. The crepes are nice and thin, but thick enough to wrap everything without breaking before shoving it into your mouth. Eat the crackers while they're super-fresh and hot - like pork rinds, they get soft and blah over time.\n\nCourse 2: Minced, Fried Duck in Lettuce Wraps\nThere were also bits of crispy white noodles hidden among the pile of stir fried duck, vegetables, and saucey goodness. The sweet bean sauce is a great base for stir fries, and II enjoyed tofu, water chestnuts, pepper, carrots, onion, and whatever other vegetables were in the mix. There was just enough to give it flavour, and they clearly weren't just \"fillers\" for the dish to look bigger.\nWe eagerly grabbed spoonfuls and scooped the duck into pieces iceberg lettuce. I also enjoyed it with white rice when we ran out of lettuce. Win.\n\nCourse 3: Duck Soup\nLast to arrive was a soup made from the remaining skin, meat, and bones. The broth was surprisingly light and tasty - not at all oily! A friend said this was her favourite course for this very reason. I really wonder what they put in this broth to make it so flavourful in such a short amount of time. Tofu, duck, and nappa cabbage was plentiful and we cleaned this bowl up without a problem. I can only imagine how wonderful this soup must be on a cold, winter night.","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":4}

It's my favourite in Toronto along with Big Fat's Pulled Pork Burrito. I'm curious about BFB's breakfast one! I'm so addicted to the halibut though, that I can't seen to order anything else from BBz. I am in such a late night burrito mood tonight!\n\n \n\nI had to award both Burrito Boyz and Big Fat Burrito #1 to be fair. When I am craving a fish burrito, I go to BB. When I want something meaty, I go to BFB. It's as simple as that.\n\n1a. Burrito Boyz\nHalibut Burrito ($8.85 small, $9.73 large\n)Halibut Burrito - so much sauce, so much win!\nThe tortilla is toasted on a flat-top grill and the large gives you 1.5 lb of fish! Add a very generous helping of sauces: Lime-Chili Burrito sauce, sour cream, and hot sauce. Most of my friends get little to no hot sauce, but I like asking for two lines. Yum.\nI almost wrote this place off after trying their steak burrito - the beef was tough and unappetizing, despite the plethora of fillings. I'm really glad that I gave the place another go and tried their halibut burrito! I can ever resist its call...while curious about their veggie soy and shrimp burritos, I haven't been able to say no to halibut.\n1b. Big Fat Burrito\nPulled Pork\nI lo-o-o-ve their pulled pork burrito! It's always saucy, soft, and so good with guacamole. I always manage to stuff myself with a large without a single regret! You can get some yam in it too!\n\n3. Burrito Bandidos\nSteak Burrito\nThis is third because I only tried their steak - I bet their fish is just as good as Burrito Boyz. If I was ranking this on the steak alone, it'd be lower but I ought to be fair since the owners used to work together at Burrito Boyz so they're virtually identical.\n\n4. Z-teca\nBeef Barbacoa Burrito\nTried the one at Fairview Mall - this a popular chain. Pretty good if you're in the area and want a burrito fix! They're also often featured on Group Buy sites, so keep your eyes open for deals.\n\n5. Chipotle Mexican Grill\nCarnitas\nOwned by McDonalds, this has been a major hit-or-miss for me. The last time I went, the person who made my burrito jammed it full of Carnitas and I was very pleased. The time before that, the server was quite grumpy and I got a small handful of chicken. Nonetheless, when I needed a quick burrito fix around Yonge & Dundas, Chipotle did the trick...until Big Fat Burrito moved in. I rather like their Cilantro-Lime flavoured rice\n\n6. Burro Burrito\nSteak ($7.99 Large)\nLocated beside my beloved Fish Store, I popped by after a game of floor hockey. This was in my early burrito-blitzing days and I think that I've since realized that steak burritos are not the way to go unless if you're ordering them from a good restaurant like my visit to Sweet Smoke's BBQ\n\n7. Burrito Loco\nChicken Burrito\nSo close to being finished before the picture was taken! Oops!\n\nOf course, there's also Sweet Smoke's Flat Iron Steak burrito but since it's at a restaurant it's in a totally different class on it's own.\nSteak Burrito win @ $9, but not quick eats on the streets of Toronto\n\nHonourable Mentions - Not true Burritos but I still love 'em:\n1. The Fish Store\nTried almost everything - best: Black Cod Burrito with Avocado\nHonestly, if this was open later and closer to my place I'd get this over Burrito Boyz any day. The Fish Store is fantastic - they offer a huge selection of seafood that you can in sandwich or a wrap (which they call a burrito). Love Love Love.\n\n2. NY Subway\nPotato burrito, cauliflower burrito, lamb burrito\nThese aren't traditional burritos either - however their potato & cauliflower burritos are great! Totally recommend getting one of these over their meaty options.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1}

A fantastic outdoor back patio includes an outdoor bar and lounge areas. \n\nThe service was pleasant and patient - We were given a bread basket with crispy flat bread seasoned with tarragon and a few slices of white bread. It was accompanied with a rather plain marinara sauce, which foreshadowed the upcoming meal.\n\nBaby Red Romaine & Escarole Salad\nCara Cara orange, fennel, shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano and old wine vinaigrette \nA light start of fresh lettuce, a slightly tart vinaigrette, ripe Cara Cara orange, and cheese. While the orange and the dressing was enjoyable, something was left to be desired...perhaps it's because of my unrefined wine and cheese palette, but I wasn't particularly impressed. Memorable Summerlicious starter salads include the butterleaf truffle salad at Truffles at the Four Seasons (which has since closed) and Tutti Matti's carpaccio salads.\n\nBigeye Tuna Tartare & Spicy Sopressata \nCracked olives, garlic grissini, arugula, lemon and Sicilian organic extra virgin olive oil \nFresh tuna tartare on a bed of salami was a welcome dish, especially since I've never tried sopressata before. The saltyness of the cured ham paired with the freshnesses of the tuna created an interesting balance between bites. The olives were typical, and the bread sticks brought a crunch but no flavour to the plate. Perhaps if they were toasted a bit more or rolled in sesame, it would've been a nice compliment to the dish.\n\nWild & Tame Mushroom Soup \nSix kinds of mushrooms (no butter or cream)\nThick, warm, and hearty - this had the rich texture of a comforting soup despite the lack of cream or butter. I was impressed with the consistency and I love the taste of mushrooms so I thoroughly enjoyed this soup. As with the salad, there was something lacking - the \"wow\" factor that I always hope for at 'licious restaurants. The best mushroom soup that I've tasted was Wild Mushroom Soup from Tutti Matti - unfortunately not on their current menu.\n\n\nGrilled Top Sirloin Fettina\nCharred onion, heirloom tomato and rocket salad with crumbled Gorgonzola\nThe vegetables were nice and warm, and the sauce surrounding the steak sweet however the steak wasn't particularly interesting or great. Tender and nicely cooked, it was a good, simple cut of sirloin but didn't blow me away or leave a lasting impression on my palette.\n\nGrilled Jail Island Salmon\nPickled summer beets, heirloom carrots, watercress salad and horseradish crème fraîche\nDespite my half-success with the fish at Biff's Bistro, I decided that it was worth another go. While tasty, I'm quickly getting bored with this Summerlicious lunch. The beets were nice, warm, and soft and the horseradish crème fraîche had great flavour. However the salmon was...just salmon.\n\nRoasted Portobello Mushroom & Brie Quesadilla\nCaramelized onions, pico de gallo, chipotle crema, plantain tortilla chips and cilantro cress\nMy personal favourite of the entrées, the chipotle cream had a tangy flavour that tasted great with the pico de gallo and quesadilla. The pico de gallo (salsa) was ripe and simple. Always a fan of portobello, these quesadillas had great flavour. While an interesting visual, the tortilla chips were lacking the flavour I usually enjoy from plantains. As a plantain chip lover, they were a disappointment. I'd rather crack open a bag of the Samai Plantain chips that I got addicted to Barbados.\n\nChocolate Toffee Crunch Cheesecake\nDulce de leche cream\nThick cheesecake that was more toffee-like than chocolate. The caramel was pleasant with the dense cake. I wasn't a fan of the bit of toffee that accompanied the cake but overall I'd say that this was the best dessert out of the three.\n\n\nBavarian Vanilla Cream\nOntario strawberry compote and dark cherry balsamic\nNice and warm with a smooth texture, the vanilla cream dessert sat on one of the better compotes that I've tried. I found myself scooping this dessert up more for the compote than the cream.\n\nCoconut Rum Baba \nTropical fruit salad and banana cream\nThis spongy cake was covered with coconut shavings over pineapple, mango, and lychee. A sweet, generous drizzle of rum syrup soaked into the cake quite nicely. While I wasn't the biggest fan of this dessert initially, over time as I enjoyed my company it grew on me. It wasn't too rich or filling.\n\nWonderfully designed and decorated, Jump Café & Bar creates a vibrant, young, and upscale environment quite well. I would return for a drink at the bar, and the service was fantastic. However, I thought it was missing that the \"oomph\" factor that would make me wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant for future Summerlicious romps. This is a good spot to take someone who wants a very simple no-frills meal.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

That's not to say that the portion sizes aren't generous - because they are! It was just that good. Instead of picking two out of three entrees that we really wanted, we just tacked on another plate. You gotta make the visit count, right?\n\nExcited to Hoof-it-up, I got there a bit early and was surprised to find a line quickly gather behind me. Luckily, I was relaxing on the bench & enjoying the Sunday morning otherwise I wouldn't have gotten a table (not that the bar would've been bad). By 9:45AM, quite a few fellow brunchers were eagerly peering through the window in anticipation of the 10AM opening time.\n\nThe cafe itself is quite small, so go early if you want to avoid a wait or would prefer a seat by the window. Similarly, I arrived at Black Hoof right when they opened at 6PM, and just managed to grab a table. I wouldn't mind sitting at the bar though, they have fantastic cocktails and the service is jovial and chatty. However, for a group of more than 3 people a table is clearly better.\n\nBone Marrow Strawberry Beignets\nWinning Combination: Cinnamon, Sugar, Bone Marrow, Strawberries & Long Peppers\nThese delicious little bone marrow pastries are coated in sugar and cinnamon. The donuts were hot, fresh, and filled with a sweet strawberry and long pepper jelly. Deep fried bits of joy, these were the perfect size and a tasty $5 appetizer. More please!\nThe two other starters are currently available for $5; a pastry filled with bacon as well as ribs in a beer sauce. While curious about the others, these donuts were a winning choice. Well...honestly based on the entire meal, I'm convinced that anything would be a solid option!\n\nBeef Tongue Grilled Cheese\nWhen I spotted this on the menu, succulent memories of Beef Tongue on Brioche from Black Hoof wafted through my mind. Slathered and fried, the buttery bread had toasty grill marks and neatly sandwiched an extremely tender and generous portion of beef tongue. I needed to erase the disaster that was Friday's T&T's rubbery beef tongue from my mind and this just blew it away. Hello satisfaction.\nPacked with comforting flavour, every bite made me stop to savour the combination of Provolone, Brie, crispy-buttery bread, and amazing thinly-shaved beef tongue. The little piggy-skewer with 4 pickles was a nice touch, similar to Black Hoof's Beef Tongue on Brioche Sandwich. Between the two, I'd say that this was better...but trust me...they are both delicious. Not bad for my first grilled cheese sandwich!\n\nSuckling Pig Eggs Benny\nPerfectly runny egg yolks, light Hollandaise sauce over pickled jalapeño\nThe Eggs Benny was perfectly poached. Warm yolk slowly oozed out when pierced with a fork, and every bite was covered in heavenly Hollandaise sauce. The sauce wasn't too rich, and did not mask the wonderful porky flavour on top of the fresh biscuit. The suckling pig had a barbecue flavour, and reminded me of very tender pulled pork without the sauce. The arugula had a lemony zip and the dish was surrounded by pork rinds. I could be wrong, but the rinds tasted like they were made a bit earlier as they were a bit soft rather than hot and crispy. They were spiced with barbecue powder. While a nice touch, I didn't care so much for them.\nI recently told a friend that my next food-hunt would be for Toronto's best Eggs Benedict. However, I'm pretty sure that now I've tasted this, there is no need. Even without the suckling pig, this eclipses all other Eggs Benny dishes I've ever had.\n\nBrioche French Toast with Foie Gras\nO-M-G.\nI could easily leave the description as that, because that is all that was running through my mind when we received it, while I was eating it, and after it was done.\nThe Brioche French Toast was perfect - the thick French bread was perfectly battered & fried, covered in sweet-syrupy goodness, roasted macadamia nuts, a dollop of creme fraiche, and bright red strawberries. Oh, and quite possibly the largest serving of Foie Gras that I've ever seen i my life.\nWords can't describe how great I thought it was - sweet syrup, hot fresh brioche, seared Foie Gras, macadamia nuts, creme fraiche, and fruit. How could this not be amazing?! Now I want every restaurant to start making French Toast with brioche. Like the Eggs Benny, this wins the C&T prize for Toronto's Best French Toast. Sorry Kalendar, but your banana & mango stuffed French toast was just trumped BIG TIME.\nA $26 plate French Toast might sound quite steep (it's $12 for the French Toast and $14 for the Foie Gras) but I definitely think that it's worth a try at least once. Go with a few friends and split it if you need to...\nEverything about the the meal was great. From the upbeat and friendly service to the colours and presentation of each plate.\n\nPics : http:\/\/cookiesandtomatoes.blogspot.com\/2010\/08\/hoof-cafe-charcuterie-brunch-love.html","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1}

Basically, charcuterie is a series of meaty products (cured, whipped & other preparation techniques) served on a wooden platter.\nAll offered with a pile of full-seeded mustard, a dish of teeny-tiny pickled vegetables, and we ordered Thuet Bread on the side. The Thuet bread was soft & fresh - a great accompaniment.\nThe star was the foie gras mousse - whipped to perfection, it just melts in your mouth.\n\nRoasted Bone Marrow ($9)\nHollowed with a little spoon & sprinkled with a bit of coarse salt on top of warm, smoky bread, this was tasty and good for the immune system. I reminded myself of the health benefits as I savoured each bit of fatty, rich, comforting flavour.\n\nTongue in Brioche ($13)\nThe sandwich was a ridiculously generous portion of thinly sliced beef tongue between two plump slices of fragrant brioche, all held together with a skewered cornichons. A healthy (hah!) dose of mustard and tarragon mayo drizzled all over made my heart skip - whether it was in fear or excitement, I'm still not sure.\nIncredibly soft and tender, prior to this delight I didn't know that tongue could be this delectable. While I prefer the buttery & decadent Tongue Grilled Cheese at Hoof Cafe, I would never turn down this sandwich.\n\nRaw Horse Sammy w\/ Hot Sauce ($22)\nFresh bread topped with horse tartar with a raw egg yolk & shallots on one slice, and a liberal helping of hot sauce on the other. The \"HORSE\" spelled out in sauce was a fun touch. I couldn't believe how tasty the raw horse meat was - I tried it with and without the hot sauce & bread to get a sense of the true flavour.\n\nVisit #2\nCrispy Pig Ear Salad\nStrips of breaded & deep-fried pig ears over radishes, carrots, edible flowers with a lime buttermilk dressing\nI liked the pig ears, but I found the dressing too buttery and generous on the salad. As someone who prefers light, acidic dressing (or none at all with the right greens!) it was unappetizing. However, I was at the Black Hoof so this was to be expected.\nThe pig ears were crispy as advertised, and full of fatty-flavour with each bite. A dining companion claims that Buca does a better version...\n\nFluke Crudo\nFluke along with charred fava beans, avocado cream, sliced chili, pancetta, herbs & cilantro dressing.\nI really liked the avocado cream and fava beans. A little heavy on the dressing (but again, it's Hoof!) but the combination of the sliced chili & cilantro was delightful with the fish. Love the plating :)\n\nN'Duja & Corn Tagliatelle\nHouse tagliatelle noodles with charred corn, charred cherry tomatoes, and the n'duja which is a spicy calabrese salami melted into the pan. Garnished with a green onion salad on top.\nMmm. I realy enjoyed this - house pasta was al dente and the creamy sauce blended very well with the charred corn and tomatoes. I still have trouble pronouncing it, but the n'duja was quite tasty with a bit of heat and I would happily order this dish again. Creamy, spicy, & corny goodness. I love sweet corn!\n\nPork Belly, Squid,& Melon\nBaby squid, Berkshire pork belly & chunks of melon in a watermelon glaze with turmeric, cumin. Flaxseed, Vietnamese cilantro, mint, & basil also riddle this succulent dish.\nWhile the pork belly and the squid were both well done and delicious, the pairing did not do much for each other. They were enjoyed separately with the watermelon glaze. I must have gotten a good chunk of watermelon, as a dining partner-in-crime said she didn't taste the melon but I certainly did. As usual, the pork belly made me pause to fully enjoy the flavour. So decadent and perfectly pan-cooked.\n\nCalf's Brain Ravioli\nHouse ravioli in sage, brown sugar, & butter sauce with Parmesan shavings\nSo...It was an oily mess, and I was very glum as a result. From the poor presentation, meagre calf brain filling, blah pasta, and too-sharp cheese I reluctantly ate all 5 raviolis wondering why I was even bothering with each bite. It was cooked al dente, just like the tasty tagliatelle, but I don't think that that is the best way to cook ravioli. Sigh. A fellow diner sampled a bit of my dish and agreed that it was simply not good. Darn it. But that's 1 bad dish out of so many amazing ones...so all is forgiven =)\n\nPics: http:\/\/cookiesandtomatoes.blogspot.com\/2010\/08\/black-hoof-charcuterie-dinner-love.html\nPics: http:\/\/cookiesandtomatoes.blogspot.com\/2010\/09\/black-hoof-charcuterie-dinner-love.html","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1}

Me and 12 friends booked the party bus expecting a great Vegas club experience. Let me start by saying the hop is a club crawl. Meaning you walk through the casinos to get to the various clubs. \n\nTo start, we met at Mandalay's House of Blues.  The House of Blues was the first stop. We went in for about 15 minutes then walked to the second location which was the Foundation room also located at Mandalay hotel. After that, our tour director (lol) walked us to the third club L.A.X(Luxor).  By then our feet hurt from all the walking so no one went inside the club. We sat outside the club until it was time for the next destination. If we had known this was a club walk, we would have worn walking shoes. \n\nFollowing LAX , we finally got on the over booked party bus (There were not enough seat). Luckily two individuals decided to abandon the field trip after walking to LAX. Anyway, the fun began on the bus where we were served watered down premixed drinks. We danced and got a little wild until rain water started leaking into the bus from the overhead emergency exit. The Party host did seem to care that we were getting rained on. \n\nDue to the rain, we skipped the Vegas sign photo op. \n\nFinally, the final destination and the end of the hop was the Chateau club located in the Paris hotel. This club was hopping and we partied for a couple  hours. \n\nDon't waste your money. You'd be better off renting your own limo bus.  Note to Posh...

Perhaps we are not accustomed to eating BBQ in such quantities, but we hardly made a dent. The variety was very good to sample each of the meats that are offered, as well as two sides. Meats included full rack of ribs, brisket, pulled pork, meat loaf and chicken. We started with the ribs, and while  happy with the portion, I must say that I was disappointed in the meat itself. I'm not sure if they were baby back ribs, but they tasted more like side ribs, and were kind of dry. I am not a BBQ expert, so maybe real BBQ ribs are not supposed to be moist, but if juicy is wrong, then I don't want to be right! The rest of the platter was decent. The sides were probably my favorite part of the meal. We got fries, coleslaw and potato salad. I love sides in general, and all of the sides were excellent. The fries were crispy but not overly crunchy, the coleslaw was creamy and sour, but not too creamy, and the potato salad, topped with some paprika, was one of the best that I've had. There are also two bottles of house BBQ sauce on the table that you can add to your meats; I dumped it in massive amounts all over. The spicy one is pretty good, with some kick but not overbearing. I didn't not try the mild one. \n\nThere are two parts of the meal that are my focus: the sides (as mentioned above), and condiments, including any sauces or little extras that add to the meal.

With an open kitchen, customers can watch their food being cooked and any interactions in the kitchen. That day, the manager reprimanded one of the cooks; not only did this slow down the food being prepared, but it was unprofessional.

As we walked in, I was immediately doubtful of my agreeableness. Not only was the restaurant empty, there was an Asian man mopping, and he looked to be the chef. He quickly greeted us, told us to sit anywhere and brought us some hot green tea. At this point I was confused - green tea with pasta? But we went on anyway because he was actually very friendly, and I felt like I just walked into my uncle's house. \n\nWe ordered the butternut squash ravioli and the osso bucco. After ordering, the chef disappeared a while. When he returned, he had two bowls of butternut squash soup and some garlic bread. While it was a little bland, I enjoyed the warm soup on a cold day, and appreciated the complimentary amuse-bouche while we waited. \n\nNot long after, our mains were served and I must say I was impressed. My SO's osso bucco was accompanied with vegetables and some penne pasta, while my bowl had 4 large ravioli in a rosé sauce, which was perfectly cooked. While I am not a pasta expert, I believe that the ravioli was made fresh and in house. The pasta itself was slightly chewy, with a generous amount of butternut squash in between. The sauce was a little overwhelming but I swept some of it to the side, which the bf gladly soaked up with the garlic bread. The osso bucco was also delicious; the veggies were cooked well, as was the pasta. But the star of the dish was the veal. The marrow was a nice treat to spread on the garlic toast (and on its own), and the meat itself was soft, tender, and well-seasoned. We ended the meal with complimentary tiramisu, which was excellent. \n\nOverall, Agio has a homey atmosphere, with delicious food. While small and easily missed, it is worth it to give it a try.

Sign of good customer service. \n\nWe ordered a variety of items on the menu including smoked monkfish liver, beef tongue and many different skewers. I really enjoyed the monkfish liver - it was actually my favorite dish of the night. The beef tongue was okay, a little chewy but good flavors. Very smokey. Upon tasting the first skewers that came out, my boyfriend commented on the temperature of the grill, that it wasn't hot enough. While I don't know much about grilling or temperatures, I trust his judgement in this area. As we received the rest of our skewers, each one had more char, and better flavor and texture. \n\nOf the skewers we ordered, my favorites were the liver, pork cheek, and pork belly. My least favorite was the sasami or chicken tenderloin; I found it a little dry and not enough flavor. \n\nI believe that there is great potential here at kintori, and will eventually live up to the standards set by its Guu counterpart.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I just moved from MN and my car was overheating. I took my car to the shop and explained the situation. They are very nice but that does not mean that the advice they gave me was right. They played the guessing game with the car looking at the water pump, temp sensor, thermostat, which were all options. They had told me that they had ruled out a blown head gasket, which I was pretty sure was not the issue as I was not leaking coolant anywhere and never needed to fill up.\n\nAfter being there almost a week they had asked me if they could take it to another shop, but would have to charge me because they were being charged. I agreed and the diagnostic came back as a blown head gasket. I found this odd and they texted me a picture of the diagnostic, which showed that they actually were not charged for the service. They had quoted me that it would be $3,100 to get it fixed, which also seemed really high. I paid the $90 diagnostic and picked my car up 7 days after delivering it.\n\nI was going through a bit of a cash flow problem and limited my driving and washed the temperature. I noticed as the temperature started to cool recently, the car would have to be under extreme stop and go traffic or if I had my a\/c on low the temp would rise to the 3\/4 mark.\n\nYesterday I took my car to another guy. He quickly determined a few issues that were causing my problem. He stated the radiator was not operating properly and the radiator fans were working intermittently, as well as they were weak when actually operating. He did this from his house. New radiator, new radiator fan motor, transmission flush, and labor it cost me $550. I put my car through a test today driving around for an hour in stop and go traffic and blasting the a\/c...... the problem has been fixed. \n\nSO the company that did the diagnostic? I thought this was a GM dealership as he had stated, I checked with the 2 dealerships within a few miles of their shop, my car was not taken to either one of them. They also stated that a blown head gasket at their shop would only run about $2,200. That was at a dealership and was $900 cheaper than this place. Plus they did not take it to either dealership, so I am not sure where they took it for the $90 they charged me and of course was a wrong diagnostic.\n\nThe trust factor with this place is now gone. I felt I should update my findings as I previously appreciated their due diligence, but now feel a bit ripped off.

Store # 6422, Fashion Square Mall, Scottsdale, Arizona.Tonight was the worst experience ever there!  I am a regular Zara Customer having shopped in Chicago, California, and Arizona locations for 8 years now.  This evening, I was shopping in the store for a total of 20 minutes from start to finish.  From the moment I walked trough the door this evening, not one sales associate said a word to me.  No one helped us!  My daughter and I made quick selections for her to try on because we needed something specific, and she headed towards the dressing room.  It was 8:57 at that moment, when the cashier, Maria Marte, was the first person in the entire time I was there to say anything to me.  Here is what she said, \"We are closed.\"  I replied, \"Its 3 minutes to closing, you aren't closed yet, my daughter wants to try 3 blouses on, and then we should be able to make a purchase quickly.\"  The cashier at Zara, Fashion Square replied to me, \"Well I'm closing my register.\"  \n\nAt 9:02 pm, the cashier Maria Marte turned to me and said, \"I'm closing my register.\".  I said in return, \"We are going to make a purchase, my daughter is finishing up in the dressing room.\"  Where in she stated, \"Well we are closed.\"  I said, \"You won't let us make a purchase?\"  Maria the cashier then said, \"Well my manager said to go ahead and close my register.\"  I asked to speak to the store manager, because this didn't seem right. It was no way to treat a customer who is trying to make a purchase at 2 minutes after 9:00 pm\n\nAt that moment, the assistant store manager came over to us.  His name is Ruben Sanchez.  Ruben turned to me and said, \"We are closed.\"  I said, I realize this, but we are about to make a purchase.  He then said, \"Well our registers are closing.\"  I looked at my watch and said, \"It's 4 minutes after, won't you give us some grace and let us make a purchase?\"  Ruben the assistant store manager at the Scottsdale, AZ store turned to the cashier and said, \"Close it down.\"  Then walked away from me.  I said to Maria the Cashier, \"I come 9 years out of Retail Sales, and have worked for Nordstrom and Barney's New York.  This is never an attitude that a sales associate should have towards a customer that would like to make a purchase.  Generally, at 9:00 pm closing you close the front door, but let any customers still in the store at that time finish out their transaction, make the purchase, then allow them to leave.  This is within a reasonable amount of time, it's 9:06 now.\"  Maria the cashier then said, \"Well my manager told me to close the register.\"  I replied, \"Even if that means you won't allow me to make a purchase.\"  She said, \"Yes.\"  After begging them to take my money, I finalized my transaction at 9;06 pm, with purchasing a white blouse my daughter had selected.  I don't think I could ever shop at the Zara Scottsdale, Arizona ever again.  They treated me so meanly and made me feel as though I was being kicked out, when all I was doing was buying a blouse and being a loyal customer.","useful":7,"funny":10,"cool":1}

Tim Brown, son in law of the owner, was assigned to us.   Tim came out to look at the property and we gave him the plans for the pool that was installed as well as the Plot plan for the house.   We discussed what we wanted with Tim and left to draw an initial plan.   Days later Tim emailed a basic plan and a video of his ideas, So far So Good.   In the meantime we contacted a couple of much larger pool companies, including one that we had used before and has a very good reputation.   Its a good thing we did as the other companies check the codes and found setbacks restrictions that Tim was unaware of.   Due to the research of the other pool companies, we had Tim redraw the plan with those setbacks in mind, as well as some other ideas.   This happened on a number of plan iterations, where another pool company would have a great idea and we would share that idea with Tim to incorporate into our plan.   There were many differences in design quality such as AZ Rainfall uses Alumawood for their Ramadas as opposed to building from scratch like all other builders.   We informed Tim that we would have to check with our association as their rules required similar building materials as the original residence.   All of the sudden I get a call from Tim Brown saying they didn't have the time to send a final plan for approval by the HOA, without which we could not get approval.\nIt appears that this well over $100,000.00 job was no longer of interest to AZR.   I guess that the demand for pools and landscaping is strong enough that some builders that are not big enough to perform certain jobs find it easier at the last minute to withdraw, having wasted valuable client time.  So if you have a big job, and are a good buyer, you might want to go with a more experienced and larger pool\/spa company.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

We just moved to Anthem from Dallas Texas and were looking for a great pizza\/Italian place to eat at, but this is NOT the place.  We entered and there were only two other  dinners in the place, one was a family of 5 and the other was a family of 3, we were a party of 2.  We were seated and told that are waitress would be with us in just a minute.  Well, that minute turned out to be about 10 minutes.  Having had time to read the menu about a dozen times while we waited, when our waitress finally did show up we were ready to order but she ask us if we wanted to put in a drink order?  Really???  So we did put in an order for 2 glasses of wine and asked for water as well.  About 10 minutes later we received our wine (very small pour indeed) and no water?  As we were waiting for our food order (I'll get to that train wreck in just a minute) we noticed that the other two occupied tables were having issues with their orders and all we could hear was the waitress consistently apologizing, we also watch as the other tables food was delivered, ONE freaken plate at a time, first one child got some breadsticks, then about 4 minutes later the other child got a salad, then about 10 minutes later the father got his order, then they apparently asked for water and it was delivered ONE glass at a time by the same server (not waiter???) then we experienced the same absolutely mind numbing food delivery, with the exception that I had ordered the 10\" pizza (which was pretty good after a 20 minuet wait) but my wife had ordered a chicken pasta dish, which we never received.  The waitress brought the pizza and two plates and started to walk away and I ask where my wife's meal was and she looked stunned, walked away and came back and told us that she had turned in the order but the \"kitchen\" must have misread it, but she would re-enter the order, well that was about 2 glasses of wine each and one very small pizza later, which had already taken about 55 minutes....duh!  So we simply told her to cancel the order and we would just pay for the pizza and wine and be happy to leave.  It was one of the worst dinning experiences we have ever had.  The \"manager\" was there, tending a small bar, at which NO ONE was sitting, but he did manage to go and clean the back door glass while all of his customers were waiting for service.  It was a totally dysfunctional, totally unacceptable experience and I doubt that we will ever return, unless my wife bets me that it couldn't possible be that bad on a second visit and I might be willing to accept that \"sure bet\"!!!  Unfortunately in Anthem the dinning options are very limited and even the Legend Sports Bar (well, sort of a sports bar) is failing as it changes management???  I ordered a pizza there last  week and was told after a 15 minute wait that they had no cheese for the pizza because the whole kitchen\/management team just weren't ordering any food?

When we first started eating there it was absolutely excellent.  Our last few visits, today and last week were not good at all.

Additionally, the honey mustard dressing must have been diluted because it has absolutely no taste and of course was minimally applied.  Another major concern is that while eating the salad, it seemd very gritty, almost like there was sand or dirt on the leaves?  Bad taste as well.  I used to get the lobster bisque but quite ordering that because it seemd that they putting more filler stuff \"celery\" etc. in it and less pieces of lobster.  The Tomato Basil is still very good so that's my go to for soup, assuming we ever go back.\nAs for customer service?  Spotty at best.  Today the server behind the counter at the soup ask if I wanted any soup, I said yes, a small Tamato Basil.  I got up to the register (very crowded) and there was no soup?  The server of the soup had this blank stare on her face like \"did you want soup\"?  Then the cash registers were not working properly and we stood at the counter with our soup getting colder by the minute and 4 to 5 minutes later we finally got to sit and eat.  Only other comment (not a good one) is that the water out of one of the soft drink dispenser tasted very bad?  Not sure why but certainly something to be concerned about.  Well, that's it folks!

When I have sold to them, I have brought in items that were brands like Calvin Klein, BCBG, Express, Limited, Gap, Forever 21, Old Navy, and bebe, but they just dig through the bag, pull out the clothes from Target, and purchase those. They reject the rest of them, claiming things like they \"never heard of those brands\" or \"those are older people brands.\" The purchasers have always been very young ladies, probably still in their teens, but I'm still surprised they are unfamiliar with these brands. If they are specifically looking to buy and sell clothing for teens, it seems they should change their marketing to reflect this, because that is not the impression I get from their online presence and store name. My suggestion to shoppers would be to just head across the parking lot and buy your  clothes directly from Target, where you'll likely pay less for them new than they are charging for them used.","useful":0,"funny":2,"cool":0}

Baja Soul has a rather unfortunate location. Although they are in Birkdale, they are tucked in the back as opposed to on the main drag, so you will likely only see the place if you are purposefully looking for it. Once we finally found it, we went in and stood at the front and looked around and saw just a few diners, but no staff.  After a minute or two, we were about to leave, when someone came and greeted us.  After that rough start, the service was friendly. They serve complimentary chips and salsa. I did not have any of the salsa, but it looked good. The mahi mahi fish tacos were very good, but be warned that they are spicy.  The Mexican Street Corn is awesome.  I did not care for the fried plantains, but they were prepared fine. I'd just never had plantains before and found that maybe they aren't my thing.  I'd say give this place a shot if you are a fan of trying different kinds of tacos.

However, I haven't been going to this one lately because of how bad it was the last few times I went. I got chicken nuggets that tasted horrible. How can you ruin chicken nuggets? I got a salad that was significantly smaller than usual and contained wilted lettuce. I don't even think it was the same type of lettuce usually used in that salad. Worst of all, the service wasn't good in the drive-thru, and good service is usually a cornerstone of any Chick-fil-a. The last time I went through the drive-thru was on a weekend. It appeared that only teenagers were working and there were many of them. The restaurant wasn't crowded, but it took forever to get through the drive-thru. I've seen them get two long lines of cars through in no time, but not this time. While I was waiting in the line of cars, I suddenly heard yelling. Apparently two young employees were arguing by the open door between the ordering speaker and the window. I got to listen to that go unchecked for awhile in the slow moving line. When we finally got to the window, there were probably 10 teenagers standing around chatting about their love lives and various other things, but nobody was standing at the window to take my money or give me my order. There was one young lady who was trying to get everyone to work, but she was being ignored. Finally, the one person doing any work got our order together and took my money and gave me my food. After all that, they forgot my honey mustard sauce! My suggestion would be to have a responsible adult member of management work on the weekends, because the kiddos aren't managing themselves.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I think if they would try to be a little more personable they could drum up more business, because they have a good product and good business idea.  I actually liked their old location better, but I can see why they moved, because the old one wasn't very visible.  I think more parents and little ones would come to the new location if they would make it easier to enter with a stroller.

The first two times were for lunch. The food was mediocre, at best.  Their breakfast menu looked so good, though, that I decided to give it a try. Let's just say that this place really needs a management overhaul. The whole experience was shockingly bad. First, we were greeted by a young man who kept wondering off, coming back by, saying, \"hold on,\" wondering off again, and then finally seating us in a restaurant that wasn't even particularly crowded. A little unusual, but no big deal so far. A waitress came in a reasonable amount of time and took our drink orders. My ice tea was horrid. It definitely did not taste freshly brewed and had an artificial lemon flavor to it. She took our orders, and brought the children's (burnt) food quickly. Then about 15 minutes later, came back and said they were out of what I had ordered. I found something else to order, and someone eventually brought it along with our other adult meal. Our food was cold when we got it, and of course the kids were done eating by then.  We then didn't see our waitress for about 45 minutes, long after we had finished eating our cold food and were trying to entertain our children who were understandably getting restless at that point.  We were finally able to flag her down and get our bill. I never once saw any sign of management anywhere. I can't say that I would recommend the place, unless they get new management and some major staff training, which is a shame because it's a nice  looking place and has a potentially good menu.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

It looks like they never clean under the tables at the couches.  I also have noticed they don't have the greatest sanitation rating, which is a little frightening for a sushi restaurant.  The main problem, though, is the service. It's just always bad.  It doesn't matter if it's crowded, not crowded, lunch, dinner, weekend, weekday. I've tried all different times and it's just consistently bad--even when the owner is there. He seems to just wander around doing nothing and not noticing that people aren't being attended to by the servers.  Refills are hard to come by and the delivery of the food is strange.  After waiting for awhile, someone at the table may receive an entree when nobody else has even been served their soup or salad.

I had to spit them out in the bathroom to avoid food poisoning. The mashed potatoes served with the over priced surf & turf had to be instant! Although I can't be positive about the mashed potatoes, the texture and flavor definitely tasted like it. There is no outdoor smoking area, you can't take your drinks outside (laws and all). The dinning area was claustrophobic and they wouldn't split the check (understandable, but still annoying). Overall, not the best experience. My suggestion, if you're someone who prefers quality over quantity (cheap happy hour), this is not the spot for you. Save your money. Go somewhere with more integrity. Somewhere that doesn't insult the intelligence of its patrons. Really? Instant mashed potatoes with surf & turf. Tacky.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I can understand when things are busy it is hard to accomodate special requests (even simple ones like mine) but as a customer (who is paying $20 + for dinner), I don't think I should have to worry about if my order will stress the chef out.

While I can only hope that if I had requested a Deep Tissue massage over the Swedish that it would have been more worth it, honestly- the pressure was non-existent. \n\nWhat was even more upsetting to me was that the whole reason I went in for a massage was because I was having some neck issues and made sure to make it known to the therapist before the session began that was what I wanted to focus on...and she basically just did a typical body massage. I've had many massages and that's what she did- no focus on the area \/reason I went in there in the first place. And the fact that I paid $70 (not including tip) for this makes me uber regrettful. Sure, I could've complained and tried to direct her movement and pressure but you don't pay that much money to go in there and do that. \n\nI feel like this place has a lot going for it but I think it would be greatly beneficial for the therapists to do more of a \"consultation\" with the client to see what it is they want exactly and then make sure they stick to that.","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":0}

We ended up with 3 different waitresses taking orders from us (weird) and NEVER  order the crunchy chicken sandwich. The first one came our and I took a bite which was just bread I then opened it up to find that I had scared the chicken into the furthest corner of the bun.

It's Saturday and at 12:01 PM, we are already lined up at the Priest. It's cozy, nuff said. The smell is great, just enough to start the salivation process. The fresh meat is nicely formed into balls up, as each serving awaits it's transformation. I chat with some other patrons, it must be my good looks, because others are asking me what this is and what that is. I reply quickly, I am a Burger Priest virgin. I order a double-double for my significant other and 'The Priest\" for myself. Somehow this seems wrong, given my strict catholic upbringing and years as an alter boy. Then my world is shattered. The mushroom fryer is broken. OH THE HUMANITY. So I opt for the double-double and an order of fries. I go for tomatoe, onion and mayo. Let the burger sing it's own song people. It's juicy, the meat flavour is there. Nice crisp on the patty and a minimal bun. It's good, but where are the angels, the path to the white light? Still waiting. Could you and I make these burgers at home? Of course. Is this the holy trinity of meat, bun and add ons, as others have stated? Not in my opnion, or at least not yet. Are they good, absolutely. Eating out is not just about convenience, we are after all, social creatures.

Not so. The patty is perfectly cooked, juicy, full of flavour. The samosa has great crunch and there is just the right amount of spice. On paper it doesn't work, in your mouth it works wonderfully.

It was Sunday Brunch and we arrived around 1pm.  The line was loooooong but that was expected.  Once seated at the table, my husband and daughter decided to tackle the ONCE AGAIN LONG LINE at the meat carving station while I decided to tackle the shorter line at the seafood station since I was already starving at this point.   While chowing down on the SUPER SALTY crab legs, I wondered where my husband and daughter were since they still haven't sat down to eat with me.   It nearly took them 30 minutes standing in line at the meat carving station!!  By the time they joined me at the table, I was ready to sample the rest of the food.  I then walked all the way towards the back to the Asian section (by the way the flow of the buffet just doesn't make sense!) to maybe try some sushi or sashimi.   There weren't that many good sushi selections either that's all they has or they just don't replenish fast enough.   I decided to skip the Asian section and walk my way towards the front.  I wanted some cured meats and cheese, but yet again the Parmesan cheese was a whole big block -no shavings or pieces one would have easy access to.  I was looking around for a knife maybe I thought one had to shave the cheese off himself, but no tool was around!  I was really getting frustrated at this point, but I still decided not to give up and try the meat carving station.  I had wishful thinking that the line was going to be shorter this time than when my husband and daughter were here.  Needless to say, the line was not any faster but at this point this was my last resort the last station i want to try since they have Prime Rib - my favorite, so I patiently wait for my turn.  Finally I get Prime Rib with Au Jus on my plate and  FINALLY join my family at the table, to only find out they are ALREADY DONE EATING!  I don't blame them since I was gone for almost 30 minutes!!!   To top it all off, the Au Jus that soaked my Prime Rib was sooo salty that I could only eat 3 bites out of that meat!  I was enraged at this point that I didn't even care to try their desserts!    Not being able to eat at the same time with my family because of the ridiculously long lines at the food stations and to be fed salty dishes is just absurd!   All in all, Bachannal Buffet DOES NOT live up to the hype!   The food is so much better elsewhere!  You're better off going to The Wicked Spoon at The Cosmo or The Studio B Buffet at The M Resort.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The final mixup was on the day of closing when they included impounds in my final payment when a i had clearly requested and  signed documents saying I did not.  They acknowledged the error and  told me the docs would have to go back to underwriting again, thus causing another delay in closing. I knew that my seller would not go for a 3rd delay and I knew I had a good deal on the table.  I was told that the  impounds could possibly be removed during the servicing process, so I accepted the current situation and closed the loan with the mpounds to eliminate my risk.  I was not happy.

Having been trained in Italy, Chef Marino may appear to be Korean but he speaks fluent Italian and cooks some of the best and authentic food I have ever had in my life. My SO and I had the bruschetta and the frutti de mare pasta. He also served us a complimentary melon and prosciutto appetizer as well as a delicious tiramisu dessert.

However, I haven't gotten a chance to try it until this time at 2011.  \n\nI struggle over 30 min on what rating I should grade the Buffet at Wynn Hotel,  I don't know I should put 3 or 4 starts, for sure not 5 stars perfect rating.  Then, I settle with 3-star.  I'd like clarify, it is a 3-star within all the 5-stars hotels competition around in Las Vegas.   If you take about \"general\" rating, it may be 4-star, mainly due to atmosphere and service.    3-star is FOOD only, if good food and variety is what you are looking for.  Not to mention, I have to pay $46 per person to go in.  \n\nWhy 3-stars?  I think it failed in 5 main dishes.  1.)  The prime rib and honey-baked ham is too dry.   It almost has no juice in the meat.   2.) Seafood selection is poor, and the sea bass was over cooked.  It was too dry too.   Oyster was so small, and the spinach on top was only at room temperature.  other seafood selection is kind of limited.  I only see King-crab, sea bass, smoked salmon, and oyster.  3.) Asian and Japanese food is SUPER limited too, and doesn't taste very good.   4.) Italian food, so-so.    5.) the juice are not 100% flesh, they are from concentrated formula mixed with a flesh juice.  \n\nGood thing the \"Black pepper backed ham\"  save the day, it was cooked carefully, and the meat was carefully selected.  It has a well balance of meat and a little fat to make it juice and smooth.     King crab is not bad.  They pre-cut them in half, making it a lot easier for us to eat.  Good job.  \n\nOne thing may worth mention about the choice of drinks.   You have a choice of buffet or buffet with Champagne.   What we didn't know, and our waiter didn't inform us, is that there are actually 3 different type of alcoholic blended drinks are offered with the standard buffet.  So, you have choices not only to soda, juice and coffee (Tea), you have at least 3 other choices (more expensive)... I forgot the name.  I will try to get them next time.\n\nI feel very fortunate that I have tried a lot other 5-stars type of buffet around the world.  before, like Hyatt, Shangri-la, Four Season, Hillton,  Mandalay Bay at LV, Bellagio at LV, Mirage (back in the early 90s) ... etc    So, after having many of experience I had, I think a 3-star for food taste and choice is fair..    \n\nI tried a 2 times in the week.  one for Breakfast \/ bunch.  One for dinner.  \n\nOn the side note, comparing to Wicked Spoon which I tried a few months ago.  I think Wicked Spoon offers more choices on the desert and and salad section..\n\nGood luck on your choice and enjoy your meals.  :-)","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Occasionally when a second cashier does open she just takes cash or she just takes the last person in line while the people who have been in the line waiting get ignored. One time when this happened I walked over to the cashier and politely told her I was next in line and her comment was 'whatever' and a roll of her eyes. Absolutely no customer service skills. Also, selection is not what I am able to find at other comparable organic stores despite the distance I have to drive to get there. Lastly, the prices here are higher than other places. For example a local nonorganic supermarket down the road has some same products but a few dollars less. Planet organic hikes up their prices probably because they can get away with it I due to the higher end clientele they serve in port credit. I am giving this place no  more 'chances'.

Their roast chicken, made on location, is ruined as it is slathered with horrible bbq sauce. In fact, most of their hot meat items are slathered in this sauce. Their customer service is simply deplorable. Their cashiers look miserable and pained even when they have to say the total price of your order. The parking is a mess. Very dangerous. Lastly, and certainly not least, the male employees noticeably come out and circle any good looking girl, woman, lady etc... that walks in to the store. I know this because it happens to me and makes me uncomfortable. They will slowly yet obviously start coming out of the back and the aisles and circle\/pass by you a couple of times.

I spent a lot of time with the person at the front desk, making sure that I was matched with someone who would take the time to get to know me and the hair style that I wanted to achieve.  I was booked the following week with 2 different stylists.  One for hair color and another for a cut.  I showed up ON TIME.  I waited 15 minutes for the the colorist (Lauren) to greet me and start services.  I asked to speak to the lady who was going to cut my hair.  Everyone was rushed and no-one wanted to take the time to get to know me.  The colorist starting applying the color to my hair and informed me that there was not enough time for my hair cut. If I wanted to get my hair cut, I could come back another day or she could cut my hair.  The rudeness was unbelievable.  I was really looking forward to trying a new salon and stylist.  After much discussion, the manager came over and apologized.  I explained that the cut was the most important part of the day. Because there was not enough time for both, I opted to have the color washed out of my hair and have my hair cut with the person (leah) who I was scheduled with for the cut.  I waited 45 minutes for her, which meant I could have continued with the hair color and been fine with timing.  I came back the next day for Leah to color my hair. She barely said 5 words to me.  I paid $20 more for her to color my hair for a total of $85 for a root touch up.  There was NO offer by the salon for compensation for that fact that I had to come back to the salon TWICE.  The manager was nice and apologetic, but the attitude of the stylists was appalling.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":0}

We arrived a little after 6:30pm, and there was no one at the hostess stand to greet us.  We waited a few minutes, and then I popped my head around to the bar area, and caught the bartender's attention.  She looked at me and continued talking to two people at the bar.  She didn't bother to acknowledge our presence or to go and get someone to seat us.  The bar area, as well as the restaurant was fairly empty, with just a few tables of customers.  My husband and I continued to wait at the hostess stand, and then we were approached by a customer who wanted to know where the nearest gas station was located, so that he could go get some cigarettes.  Yes, we were standing there that long. I finally walked over to the bar and asked the bartender if we could be seated.  She told me to \"wait a minute\", to which one of the customers told me to relax and wait.  The customer then proceeded to spill a beer all over himself and the bar.  At that point the bartender reluctantly took us to a table.  I asked her to send a manager over to speak to us.  The manager came out and cleaned a table,  glanced our direction, and walked away.  When our server finally came to our table, I asked to speak to the manager.  He came to our table a few minutes later.  I asked if the bartender had let him know that we needed to speak with him,  His response, \"she said that you all had been waiting a while, but didn't tell me that you wanted to talk to me.\"  SERIOUSLY.  What manager would not immediately go apologize to customers who had to wait in an empty restaurant to be seated at a table???  He gave a mild apology.  This is the worst service that I have ever received in a restaurant, and never mind that we spent $100 for dinner.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0}

There are many ideas about what German Shepherds should be and do act like, but both my boyfriend and I found it truly important to make him the sweetest dog possible. We do not want a robot dog that loses all personality because of training via \"being broken\". Romp exceeds our expectations every time with this regard as, while learning to be obedient for safety and fun, our puppy grows his personality each and every week! It is amazingly spectacular! \n\nPlaytime: Matt's highly professional and super caring staff always make our puppy feel loved and missed every week. It is almost like its his second home here, where all his friends live too. We absolutely love receiving his report cards at the end of each playtime, telling us what his \"paw\"sonality, what his favorite activity, who his best friend, and any room of imp\"ruff\"ment was that day. FYI...he's a straight A student so never any room for imp\"ruff\"ment here, but the staff will let you know if you need to work on something with your dog. Our puppy adores these play sessions and comes back exhausted from his long day of fun. I do have to say that I always speak to Savanna and she is the best! \n\nGrooming: Amanda always makes him look so cute! She really does a terrific job and has over 20 years of experience!

When I met Annie, the experience was ENTIRELY different!!! The first thing she asked me was what I envisioned for my hair color, what I did not like about it, and how I thought it would be perfect. Another thing she said was that anytime I was bored with my hair to feel free to tell her and she would revolutionize it again. She stayed true to her promise in the now two years that I have been seeing her. I also LOVE that if I want something new done to my hair and it is not fashion forward, she will work with the idea until it is. It always comes out even better than the original thought!!! I keep telling her that she needs to start her own product line too so hopefully that is to come soon!!! :D\n\nAs far as the vintage portion...Miles runs that.

If you want to go, reserve your spot at least a few days in advance. \n\nAnyway, we finally got in and saw Jack Ryan. The tickets were NOT worth the money to sit in this \"exclusive\" theatre. We decided to make a full date of the experience and also have dinner at the theatre. My boyfriend's food and soda came about 30 minutes before the movie ended (around 9:00pm) and I was not so lucky, my food and water never arrived!!! My boyfriend and I both asked the waiter several times when my food and water would arrive, when we could find him that is, and nothing! I asked the waiter to at least bring me some water (I was super dehydrated already) and...NOTHING!!! Finally, at the end of the movie, we complained to the waiter and he said he would get a manager. Guess what? A manager NEVER CAME!!! As I told my boyfriend that night, the difference in the comfort of the seats versus a Harkins or AMC is not large enough for me to overlook the extreme disappointment of having to wonder where the waiter is at every moment. I do not even know what happened in the movie!!! That is how preoccupied I got with where the waiter was, where the food was, and if I was even going to have water to drink!!! \n\nAll in all, the seats are comfortable, of course, if not the theatre would not bring in any business, but I strongly recommend that you just invest in a recliner for your home instead. It is way less frustrating!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I wanted to order a latte macchiato, and I don't think the lady at the cashier knew they even have this drink at first. She first put cafe latte on the machine, and I saw it and corrected it. Then I was trying to personalize my drink a bit with less ice and almond milk. After I finished my request, the lady asked me again whether I was ordering a caramel macchiato. I corrected her again that I wanted a latte macchiato. Okay, then it finally showed the right drink on the cashier. I thought this was the end of the story but NO. The guy who was making my drink held a manual with his left hand the entire time while he was making my drink with only his right hand. I even saw him made a mistake at first and started over for my drink. Finally, I got my drink, but the taste was not good as it should taste since I had the same drink several times from another Starbucks store at CU. I understand this is a new Starbucks store, and they are obviously new hires who need a lot of practice. But they clearly need more training before serving real customers.

I booked it through Orbitz, where it was listed as a 3-Star hotel and was elated to be getting a great deal... of course it was too good to be true.\n\nThe entrance\/office was absolutely nothing like the pictures... you sort of had to stretch your imagination to see the semblance from the pictures. \n\nThe rooms were simply drab, complete with hideously patterned sheets and curtains (I can't place what decade they were from). The pillows: imagine a $3.00 Walmart pillow, that has been used 50 times. The room also had an annoying odor, like an old abandoned warehouse. The window A\/C unit was one of those from the 1960's (may be not quite that old), with shabby faded wood panelling, and it was plugged into a socket that was falling off the wall. The TV: half the stations were static ridden images. The room was connected to a balcony- (a shared one). But, you guessed it.... you would not want to step into the balcony or leave your dog roaming there... Of course it smelt pretty bad because it was covered in a lime green carpet, that had not been cleaned in maybe 5 years.\n\nAnd do not be deceived by the free breakfast. I was dreaming of a continental spread with eggs, sausage... Far from it, the fruit basket  contained 20% soft rotting apples, the bread tray- the bread seemed recycled from 3 days (think of the hardened texture of bread that has been left out overnight). Needless to say I was too scared to try the coffee or milk; all I could stomach was the orange juice.\n\nAs far as location: The only plus is that it is close to a train stop, with easy access to downtown. Otherwise, there are couple of other motels in the area and nothing else; I mean NOTHING.\n\nHere are the only positives: Thankfully the sheets seemed clean and there were no roaches or rats; the bathroom was decent; and the wireless internet worked.\n\nPlease do not fall for this miserable place. I payed $85 for the night and wanted all but 100 pennies back.  I have not stayed in a 1-star motel, but I suspect this place will make some 1-star places look stellar.

The best thing about this place is that you can trust they will always have something new and really really fantastic on tap to try out.  You would think that would be a given, with 30 taps available.  But I just get this good feeling that they put a lot of heart, and hours of tasting (rough) into surprising and pleasing their patrons with the choices.\nI've enjoyed every visit I've made to Papago, but those guys made it very special for my special day.\nI haven't had the opportunity to try the food yet.

I was never very excited about their beer or food, but I love supporting local brewpubs, and I liked the atmosphere. Especially the patio and outdoor bar.\nI have a pretty forgiving palate when it comes to craft beer, but Dave's just falls flat. No complexity of flavor in any of the beers, although I haven't tried the stout. They aren't bad, they just have nothing to stand out.\nBut the reason I decided to write this review is that I was tremendously disappointed during my last visit in early Feb.  Since I work nearby my visits have often included lunch or happy hour food, and I thought they had a decent selection of affordable options. But they removed some of my go-to vegetarian items from the menu.  When I expressed my disappointment, the bartender told me they took the veggie items off because they weren't selling as much.  I can see why a restaurant might stop advertising a item that is not selling.  But there are few replacement options when you start removing vegetarian choices.  In addition, when I asked if they still made the veggie wrap at all, the bartender simply said no.   I hate the thought of being high maintenance, so I didn't press the issue. But I imagine that it wouldn't have been that difficult to do.\nSince the waitstaff was not interested in my satisfaction, and since the other food I have tried (bar food, typical salad) is just average and I prefer other beer, I won't be back.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I started with rowing, which I had never done before, and signed up for a full membership within a month.\nRowing is an incredible total body workout that quickly improves your performance in all athletic activities.  When I finally started running again, I was surprised that I was doing better than before my injury! I would never have stuck with it and developed this appreciation if it wasn't for Morten. I can't imagine a more knowledgeable and devoted rowing coach- an opinion shared by every student I've met in his classes.\nSince joining I've added spinning, boot camp and yoga to the list of classes I regularly attend. The schedule is perfect for me (early mornings, but there are evening classes as well) and I always look forward to starting my day with this group. Taking a spin or boot camp class from Linda is fun and inspiring.  She accomplishes an unbelievable amount every day, but nothing ever weakens her contagious passion for fitness.  The community of members is great too, and there are always opportunities to join others for local events like races.\nAs a person used to just getting up and running for my exercise, I never thought I would want or need to join a gym. But I am so happy I did. At Class Fitness I've found friendship, accountability, and new adventures!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I asked for a one and a half and it's the longest one and a half I've ever seen, more like a two. I asked to taper down the back and he just lined it up, and did not line up around my ears. I have to go spend more money tomorrow morning before I head out to get this re done and I have to get it a shorter size now. So angry. Don't go here for your own good.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

My beans looked like they had been sitting for quite a while, everything was hot but the beans (minor deal). Secondly and more importantly, my $8 Cadillac margarita was way to small. I've spent $6 at other places that were both stronger AND bigger. It was neither strong nor large. Great food though honestly, the steak was cooked perfectly. And the staff is very nice.

I love their boneless wings. Best flavor from any pizza\/wing place in Arizona to date (for me). I usually get regular wings because no one likes wimpy wings aka boneless, but I love the Zella's boneless. They've hardly ever messed up my orders, although I'd say the boneless wings can come smaller than normal, and you never know what you'll get.

It's been like this since I started ordering from here over a year ago.\n\n-\/+ Service. Typically I've had very lousy service on the phone. Twice it was one hour from their closing time and they told me they would not deliver. THIS is what makes me order from a large corporate chain. If they say they close at 9, and you call at 8:45, your order will STILL be delivered. I also had one lady DEMAND my building number (albeit I should know my building number, but no one has ever denied delivery without a building number) and so I hung up and ordered Papa John's. According to her she \"wasn't going to send her driver out there with no building number.\" Um, they have to look at the map anyway, get over it. HOWEVER, my delivery service has always had pleasant drivers. One girl even gave me extra ranch (shout out to you, girl!).\n\n+ Prices.

This was the second time I came here, and each time was a HUGE disappointment. I am never returning. EVER. The vet's name is Melissa Schupp. \n\n First, I arrived around 2:35 on a Sunday afternoon. I called two hours ahead of time to schedule an appointment because I knew Sundays would be busy; this is because many other animal hospitals are not open on Sundays. My dog was suffering from unknown allergic reactions with skin rashes left and right. I had just adopted him, and his skin had recently become infected and rotten-smelling.\n I called ahead of time, gave my details , a $77 quote and they reserved a room for me. When I arrived  the room was already reserved and I was led straight in. I initially thought I was going to have a great experience because of the quick room preparation but BOY was I wrong. When I was led into the room that was \"prepared,\" there was water all over the floor and the front desk lady hastily used paper towels to clean it up. I waited the standard 30 minutes in the smelly room until the nurse came into to check details, run temperature and give my dog a general physical. Then she left for AN HOUR. By this time it  was already 3:35, and my dog was whining from pain and discomfort in a closed off room. When the nurse returned and began to write down symptoms, my dog actually started peeing on floor. I didn't know what to do because I had no cleaning materials with me, so the nurse stepped into action and dropped a few paper towels on the ground. She didn't manage to soak up all the urine, so when she moved around, my dog was pushed into it and it ended all over my clothes when she asked for my to carry my dog onto the checkup table.\n\nTo make things worse, she left again for another hour, and checked in after the 40 minute mark to tell me the veterinarian would be with me after 1 minute. Ten more minutes passed and no one came. My dog was whimpering more and more at this point. Finally at 4:30, the vet comes in, smiling and kind, and asking me for doggie symptoms. I ask her about fleas, but I swear, this place was so profit driven that the VET DID NOT EVEN CHECK MY DOG FOR FLEAS BEFORE GIVING ME A PRESCRIPTION ON MY FLEA MEDICATION. The mere mention of \"I think my dog might have fleas but I don't know how to check for them\" initiated a conditioned response \"I'll prescribe flea medication\" WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE DOG. I asked kindly to hint to her that my dog might not have fleas because the itchiness could be a symptom of allergies. She then shows me how to check for fleas, but doesn't find any as she shows me. She continued to write down a prescription for fleas on my bill without my knowing. Is this a professional business? How can they cheat people like this!\nAs I continued to ask questions to make sure what my dog had, the nurse seemed to reply with more things to run up my medical bill. She gave my dog a unnecessary skin scrape for mites TWICE even though SHE SAID that it didn't seem like my dog had mites, she performed and charged me for the scrape all the same. Because I had never needed to have these operations performed, I did not know that it was an extra $30 to have skin scraped. She went to look at the scrapes under the microscope, and returned another hour later. By this time, it was 5:30 and my patience was running low. For three hours, I sat in a stuffy room, covered in urine and staring at my miserable dog scratching his skin to bloody scabby bits as the doctors and nurses neglected the both of us. Honestly, I was so frustrated, I didn't even know what to do.  I had never experienced such a horrible medical visit. \n\nAround 5:35 when she returned, she apologized for being gone for an hour, and she said she had to look over a pet with a \"real emergency.\" I'm not here to disqualify her statement, because I understand that this is a real animal hospital and that other people may have pets who are dying. But I also understand that this is a FOR-PROFIT animal hospital, and if they don't even have enough vets to go around that I have to wait three hours for something that takes less than 50 minutes, I truly will never EVER recommend this place or ever set foot near this place again.\n After she came back, she confirmed my dog had no mites, and gave me a pet \"cone of shame\" that I had asked for earlier. She told me it was $15 cone, and gave me flea medication and antibiotics for the infection. She hardly looked at my pet. The only part of the visit that was clear to my mind was that she kept saying \"ow\" when my dog nibbled at her fingers.\nI excitedly hurried out and paid my bill. EXCEPT IT WAS $207. I let the vet CUT MY DOG for $32, the flimsy cone was $30 in addition to the $29 un-needed flea meds. I cried.\nI think my only mistake was coming to this hospital. Be wary of coming here as the more questions you ask to get a better idea of your dog's condition, the more services and products they try to shove down your throat to earn revenue.","useful":10,"funny":4,"cool":0}

In addition to having a super memorable and cute logo, they have a lot of space for large events and a minimalist venue making it a versatile brewery for holding events. Today for the Panther's tailgate, they had Tin kitchen's food truck in the back for hungry folk to annihilate. I'm new to the idea of bars without food offerings inside but I find this model genius; Sycamore itself doesn't have a kitchen, instead has partnerships with local food trucks so that the menu changes every time you come. What is special about them is that they do have a wide array of special brews to choose from, so for the adventurous beer drinker, this is the perfect place for people who get bored of beer that taste just like beer. They have special brunch beer cocktails which seem to change weekly. I haven't tried them personally but they look and sound pretty interesting! Bloody Mary beer cocktail anyone?\n\n In particular for fall, I enjoyed their Cinnabun Brown Ale, Sweet Potato Wheat, Pumpkin Latte Blonde, and Gourd Have Mercy Pumpkin Amber. A pint of gourd Have Mercy Pumpkin Amber on a Sunday ran me $6, -not bad. While we watched the Panthers game inside, live music was running outside which was enjoyable once the game ended. I can imagine it being packed for weekly tailgates on days with home games, but when it is not busy, it is a very nice brewery to just sit and relax in. I haven't been here after work yet, but I always see it lit up and populated on the ride home from the light rail. We didn't see any typical backyard games like horseshoe, corn hole or giant Jenga, so I think it's a good place to go for a chill night of hanging out.

Allow your customers to serve themselves, and you'll surpass records of beer sold during your first weekend of operations. You can try and be loyal to one beer, but It's quite inexpensive to get a sampling of each (and there are dozens of beers on the wall) - beers range from 30cents an ounce to a few dollars. The wristband is convenient, just scan your band on the little hop engraving under each tap, and it will activate. Angle your glass before you press the nozzle (this is how you avoid a glass full of foam) and pour away. This place is cozy in the winter but would also be great during the summer as well.

Yes, they are famous for their sushi lunch buffet, but I have never been there for that! I declare that as the next frontier to conquer...\n\nI had read on some Charlotte email newsletters that Oku sushi was great and had won some kind of Charlotte sushi award, but I don't think you can compare Rusan's to Oku. Sure, they both serve the same thing, but the indoor ambiance really makes a difference on the dining experience. Oku sushi is more of a hipster sushi place that you'd go on a first date on, and dress up a little more to, while Rusan's really focuses on value of their sushi while exuding classic characteristics of Asian restaurant by having sticky tables and crumbs on booth seats. I wouldn't be scared to come here donned in athleisure-wear and tennis shoes. But hey, I like where their priorities are at (sushi crafting). I guess since I mentioned it with Oku, I have to say by no means would I not take someone on a first date to Rusan's- if I knew anyone who shares the same passion for fish as I do, this would be my go-to date night restaurant. It's not hipster, but it's definitely not trashy. Your chopsticks might be disposable, but the flavor variety and sushi-eating experience is everlasting.\n\n For $10, you can get anywhere from 2-4 rolls at Rusan's, while you barely can get an appetizer at Oku. Service is fast, and their fried iced cream dessert is absolutely delicious. They have so many rolls to try, so it will be awhile before I get tired of coming here. With two medium sized adult asian females, we downed five rolls and a fried iced cream and the bill came out to be $20 each.\n\n I'd take a huge group of friends here, or just eat and catch up with one friend. Either way, I can't wait to go back for the buffet, but since my office is just out of range from here, I guess I'll have to wait for a holiday.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1}

I've visited their shop at least 10 times over the last 7 months.  Their peanut butter - chocolate ice cream is probably the best ice cream I've ever had. Truthfully I would visit more often but their service is awful.  Allow me to explain -\n\nEVERY SINGLE TIME I visit they are out of something.  If I want to order a banana split they are out of bananas.  If I order a sundae that comes with strawberries, they are out of strawberries.  They always have the same excuse, Oh my manager just went to the store to get some more (insert missing item), is it okay without?  One time I was told, we are out of bananas, I suggested a discount for a banana split without bananas and suddenly out of nowhere, a banana was found.\n\nAnother thing I've noticed is, I never see the same ice cream makers in the store, always a new fresh face.  As a result, what I order is NEVER consistent.  One visit I will get a generous serving of whipped cream, the next visit hardly any.  Next visit I will get an entire sliced banana, the next 6 thin slices.  Obviously there are issues with the management and ownership of this cute and yummy little ice cream shop as this can all be traced back to them.

I rated it 3 stars, parts of my visit were impressive, others were not.  Allow me to divulge.  The menu and food selection are great.  Wide variety of offerings, prices in-line with what you get.  I was impressed and excited to get on with my meal.  I ordered from the Things in Bowls section of the menu, and opted for the Smoke in a Bowl.  The meal was good, I would have it again, filled me up, plenty of chicken, plenty of vegetables, nice flavor.  It was good, nothing to write home about, but good.  One thing I noticed, not sure exactly what black bean salsa is at SkinnyFATS, but I didn't see a single black bean in my bowl.  It was very dark where I was sitting in the restaurant so maybe I just couldn't see it.\n\nThe customer service left a lot to be desired.  It's all about training your employees, some owners\/ managers take it seriously, others don't.  The person that took my order was great, friendly, helpful, nice smile.  I should mention I was asked to provide ID as I was using my debit card.  I assume SkinnyFATS has been burned repeatedly by their customers using debit\/ credit cards that don't belong to them, hence they card you, doesn't say much about their clientele overall.  Also, I ordered a Coke, I was truly surprised when I got to the soft drink fountain and Coke wasn't an option.  Seems that should have been mentioned to me.  The person that brought me my food, didn't say a word to me, not one.  I offered a Hello and a Thank You as my food was delivered... my words were completely ignored.  Very common courtesy dictates, especially in a retail\/ business type of establishment that when offered a Hello or a Thank You by a customer, a simple reply is good business.  I assumed the person that delivered my food was having a bad day at work.  As I was enjoying my Smoke in a Bowl one of the staff was busy clearing and cleaning the table next to me.  As this person started to vigorously sweep the floor beneath and around the table next to me, I lost my appetite.  Sweeping the floor stirs up dust and whatever else is on the floor.  In my head I was imagining all sorts of debris floating around in the air and landing on my table and on top of my Smoke in a Bowl and in my off-brand Coke.  I was disgusted and soon stopped eating.\n\nSkinnyFATS and another restaurant I consider to be very similar in concept, Greens and Proteins, are welcome additions to the Las Vegas restaurant scene in my opinion.  Next time I'll probably head to G&P where I always get top notch food AND service.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I wanted a view of the city and i got an amazing view on the 50th floor. My room was non smoking once i got out of the room the hall smelled like smoke. I was never bothered by the staff and they were nice and friendly. My check in and check out process was very fast. Only thing i was bummed about was the pool it was nice but small and closed early. Wish it was open late everything else seemed to be open. I would stay here again.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

When i arrived i was greeted by some very friendly staff. I felt very welcomed. Means alot when your traveling alone. First thing i noticed about this place was the cute decor different but i liked it. Especially the use of different kind of chairs. They gave me time to figure out what i wanted and made great suggestions. I ordered food was good and i was full. Only thing that wasnt my favorite was the water but i think thats a city problem . I checked in with yelp to get a free mimosa. Mmmmm. Kinda strong but they dont play in Vegas. My bill was very affordable. The mananger was even nice enough to seat down and give me suggestions on what i can do here. Very nice and sweet of him. Go check them out.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1}

I first discovered them when I walked by and saw all of their veils in the front window. I popped in without an appointment and they were very welcoming and accommodating. After I showed them a photo of my dress and told them about my wedding and what I was looking for, the consultant said she had the perfect veil for me. It was gorgeous! Simple and elegant, but very dramatic. Their prices were also incredibly reasonable. I wasn't able to make a decision at that time, but they created a file for me and kept the veil on record. When it came time for my mom to look for her dress I recalled how many absolutely gorgeous mother of the bride and bridesmaid dresses I walked by on my way to look the veils. After going to several bridal stores in Vancouver, I suggested that my mom take a look at Ave 22. She had a really good idea of what she wanted, but couldn't find it anywhere and was having a hard time describing it to her consultants. We met with Cara at Ave 22. She was an excellent listener and has the patience of a saint! We went through a lot of dresses, and Cara was always kind and caring, and helped us with eliminating what wasn't working. Their assortment was so wonderful that we ended up finding two amazing dresses for my mom. She couldn't decide between the two, but their prices were so excellent that she ended up buying both. I also came back to try on the veil I had originally looked at. When I saw it on with my dress it was absolutely gorgeous and exactly what I was looking for. I had previously gone to Kleinfeld for look at veils and accessories, and found that I liked Ave 22's selection far more than Kleinfeld's. Thank you to Shirley, the owner, and Cara for such  wonderful and stress free experiences. I would highly recommend them to all of my girlfriends. My only regret is not finding them before I bought my wedding dress.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0}

However, with two guys working both were busy and did not even acknowledge my presence as  I stood there and circled around for 10 minutes. Not a peep. No \"will be right with you\" or anything. Finally grabbed one guy off of phone and got my pants and was out of there. But after this experience I would NEVER shop at Jos A Bank's again. I'm used to \"Nordstrom\" (and independent clothier) customer service. And this was far, far from it. Very unprofessional!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I came here with my girlfriend on a Saturday evening for a quick bite and we found our meal extremely substandard.\n\nThe draft beer and wine lists were solid and the cocktails were pretty good, so no complaints there. The food menu was focused, but one lingering question hovered over us while we browsed it:\n\nWhere the hell is the bacon?\n\nFor a restaurant with pork-themed fare, there were disappointingly few dishes that contained bacon. Plenty of pâté, tenderloin and belly but no bacon. It just seemed weird.\n\nThe cheese plate was very tasty and reasonably priced - $10 for three cheeses, toast points\/crackers and small samples of red wine poached pears and roasted beets. The beets were the only thing out of place on the plate, and although this was the high point of the meal, it's hard to give Black Pig credit for something extremely difficult to screw up.\n\nFor the entree, I ordered the croque monsieur ($13) and my girlfriend ordered the pork tenderloin ($19). My sandwich arrived and was ENORMOUS. The thing was slightly larger than my face and came with a mountain of \"pommes frites\" (Black Pig's terminology). It looked like something Adam Richman should tackle on a Man Versus Food challenge.\n\nThe huge portion size to price ratio couldn't save the uninspiring flavors. The fries were ridiculously salty and I didn't even bother taking the sandwich home despite leaving about 3\/4 of it on the plate. \n\nDespite costing $6 more, the pork tenderloin dish was much smaller and tasted as bland as it looked - plenty of brown and green on the plate but very little flavor. The pork was juicy at least, so not a total loss.\n\nOverall it was an extremely disappointing experience. The food couldn't live up to the menu, which overhypes its descriptions with meaningless adjectives - \"free range\" toad-in-a-hole, \"nettled\" risotto.\n\nWe'll probably come back for drinks, but my advice is skip the food.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":1}

She said she'd need time to \"request and review my file\", and advised me she'd call back with details. She didn't.\n\nI followed up a few days later, and she consented that she'd reverse the annual fees charged to both my account, and my girlfriend's. She didn't.\n\nI called back the following week, and spoke with \"Linda\" who informed me Amber was out sick, and she'd be reviewing my file. I politely stopped her there, and told her Amber had already told me to expect a refund. She again stated she'd have to research my file (Incidentally, what sort of \"file\" is there? I mean we are talking about a 1 sheet gym contract, right?).\n\nAt any rate, she did call me back that afternoon and told me the refund had been processed. On 5\/14, roughly 2 weeks later and 5 phone calls later it was resolved.\n\nBottom line, it was too much of a hassle. If it wasn't for the fact that they reversed the annual fees, and that I can walk to this gym, they'd be at 1 star instead of 3.\n\nhttp:\/\/davidiwritestuff.blogspot.com\/","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

It was on a whim as we had a Groupon.\n\nI'd have to say that the tour was informative, and gave perspective of how a small business was run (if you've been on any of the big distillery tours like Jack Daniels you'll notice several distinct differences). The tour was given by one employee while the owner waited at the bar until we were done to provide samples.  While giving the tour to a group of maybe sixteen people, the employee encouraged us to ask questions and kept the air of the tour light while joking throughout. As an added bonus some of the jokes were even funny! Kidding aside, levity was definitely there, without feeling forced or bordering on the lame. \n\nOnce we got through the informational portion, we all bellied up to the bar and got ready for our samples. Jason, the owner greeted every person, asked their name and shook hands. Which I thought was classy, and was certainly a throwback to a bygone era of how business was done. \n\nJason talked through the history of each spirit (Moonshine, Bourbon, Gin) and connected us to how they came into being as well as how he decided upon their names. In doing so, he also informed us about how he had gotten into the business to begin with. Personally, I found this portion extremely relatable and inspiring, though I won't spill it here, and would advise you to visit the business on your own to hear the tale.\n\nAs far as the booze, I'm not a Gin fan in any form, but otherwise the Bourbon and the Moonshine were excellent. \n\nOverall, a great way to spend an hour, particularly if you have friends or relatives in town, or to simply support an Arizona small business doing quality work!\n\nhttp:\/\/davidiwritestuff.blogspot.com\/","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

The location is convenient (a few steps away from the subway), the design is very chic and the place is beyond clean.  They greet you so warmly and they have such positive energy.  \n\nThe services I had done were underarm laser, microdermabrasion and now going for fraxel.  I've inquired about several products but never felt pressured to buy them.  They gave me samples to take home to try before I committed to a bigger bottle.  Every single product I bought, I LOVED.  \n\nBellair Laser truly is an amazing place and would recommend anybody to try it out.  You will not be disappointed.  \n\nGood job to their team & management for such amazing experiences and professional advice.  You have a life long customer!!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Every one of the people I came in contact with were 4 or 5 star people except one.  He was my night nurse and his name is Dave.  I was on the 6th floor, room #7 of Saint Joseph's Hospital.  The nurse shift change is at 7:30 pm so there was a meeting of Nurse leaving, me and nurse coming on duty ... that would be Dave.  We went over all my meds and that I was also due pain medication at 8 pm (now 7:40).  It was also discussed that my Doctor ordered an IV fed antibiotic also to drip during the night.  I called for Dave at 8:30 and asked about my medication which were due at 8 pm.  He said he was busy but would get to me soon.  At 9 pm I called Dave again who informed me that I would not be getting the pain medication because I had not specifically requested it at 8 pm. He also informed me that he decided not to do the  antibiotic drip.  I told him that I wanted both medications or I would \"unhook myself\" and go to a different hospital.  I told him I didn't feel safe with him and that I would be submitting a formal complaint in the morning.  That seemed to change his attitude and He finally agreed and gave me the meds sometime after 10 pm.  Dave avoided me most of the rest of the night.  Next morning I asked to speak with Dave's supervisor.  Someone came in who didn't really seem concerned (like this happens all the time).  While she was there my doctor came in for a routine checkup on my condition.  I told him what happened the night before and he immediately asked for the floor manager to come down and speak with me and take a report.  The Manager said she would be right down.  This was at 6:30 am and in spite of my reminders, the floor manager never did show up or contact me.  I think Dave is dangerous.

Hands down, Presidential was the top recommendation.  We met with John at the Gilbert location and he was very patient with us.  We had an idea on our pool design but had no idea at all on costs.  We explained this and he patiently designed our pool and all the bells and whistles.  Obviously it came back way over what we could afford.  But John didn't give us any attitude at all.  We were even in his office right before they were closing and he didn't shoo us out the door.  We ended up taking the quote home and sitting on it for a month.  When we finally came back, John was eager to help us redesign something that we could be proud of.  And we did!!\n\nWhen our project kicked off, our project manager, David, and John met with us at home and walked us through the entire process.  They even had this cool little website where we could track dates and milestones.  Once it got started, it went very quickly!  Our only delays were because of the holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years.. and the rain.. oh the rain).  And of course, I had soooo many questions.  David was always very responsive and easy to contact.  \n\nAt the end of our project, we scheduled an appointment with Jason and he walked us through the phone app to control our pool (yep, there's an app for that) and all the controls on our pool system.

I thought that reserving a room like that over the phone (and even paying for a night up front!) would get me the room I needed but no, there is no way to be sure that you're getting what you want or pay for at this place.\n The check-in procedure took AN HOUR thanks to an incompetent chump and sassy desk manager (she started giving me attitude like it was my fault they didn't have my room available!  wtf?) while my girlfriend sat out in the car, surrounded by drunks, in their driveway.  If that wasn't bad enough, this front desk hassle made us too late for my special birthday dinner!  Where I had a hook-up!  This was the first night in Vegas and already Mandalay Bay was losing me time and money!\n That night, I tried to put our expensive leftovers into a fridge but discovered that the only mini-fridge in the room was full of beverages that you couldn't move or else the computerized weight system would charge you immediately.  So, no fridge!  Even Super 8 has a mini-fridge!  We went to bed that night enraged.\n The next night we ordered $22 nachos from room service (there was a $5 \"cover charge\" ... just another cutthroat fee at this place).  I didn't get the room service guy's name because I was too busy staring at - seriously - LESIONS on his face, neck, and even wrist!  It wasn't acne, it was some kind of exczema or something.  I've never not eaten nachos before in my life, that night was a total waste of food and money.  Why hire room service guys who destroy your appetite!?  Isn't that a health code violation too?\n Finally, I was looking forward to talking to the front desk as I checked out.  The clerk asked the people in front of me \"did you enjoy your stay with us?\" so I figured that would be my opportunity to let Mandalay Bay know that it was really not an accomodating place to stay.  However, the front desk clerk just checked me out without even talking and moved right on to the next in line with cold dead eyes.  I should have stayed and asked for a manager but I was honestly too tired and frustrated to fight.  \n \"Disappointed\" cannot even begin to describe our stay at Mandalay Bay.

I don't do these often, as it is not in the family budget, so I was looking forward to it. And the place looked nice and shiny inside. Well, I was completely disappointed with the results. First, the pedi.The \"spa pedi\" I asked for didn't include the removal of dead skin cells with the razor or other scraping tool. The woman gave my feet a quick 10 second brush with a pink pumice and then on to the \"massage\" she prided herself on, which lasted for a whole 60 seconds at best and was nothing special. That was a huge disappointment, as this is one of the parts of a pedicure it's hard to pull off at home. I am prone to having ingrowns, so I was VERY specific that the woman should cut straight across for the pedi, leaving the corners alone! Well, she cut the nails straight across, but then she got fierce with the nail nipper. Before I even knew what she was doing, she had cut at a diagonal on the corners of one of my big toes. Worse, when I got home, I realized that she had actually visibly CUT the cuticle on the side of that same toe, further down. And I had to treat it with antibacterial ointment for several days before the pain and swelling subsided. Also, I noticed that the tools she used seem to be in her own personal toolbox, which was fine, but I have no idea if they were floating around in water or in some sort of antibacterial solution. I am praying it was the latter. [Note to self: next time look for a place that assigns you your own set of tools and stores them for you or clearly shows you how their tools are kept clean] As for the shellac mani, the woman piled on so much and so many layers of polish that it looked and felt as if I was actually wearing fake nails! And the so-called \"2 weeks at least\" shellac manicure lasted a whole of four days before the shellac bubbled at the edges and began coming off of the nails in large swathes.

He had extraordinary reviews, so we provide this one just to present our different experience.\n\nHe was immediately reachable, very prompt with arranging a home visit, and always very confident in his assertions.  While his speed in identifying our problem and readiness to discuss his (possibly excellent) credentials repeatedly would be a positive to many, we felt that he reached his conclusions a bit TOO quickly and mentioned his background and all his competitors' inadequacies TOO frequently.

We subsequently learned of a few red flags:  \n(1)  MoldEx does their own specimen collection (not the actual testing, though) which other contractors believe is a conflict of interest (i.e., there's an incentive to find a problem and to prove that the work has resolved it).\n(2)  A more thorough inspection revealed an entirely different source for our moldy smell which would NOT have been addressed had we gone with the MoldEx remediation plan.\n\nDuring this process (before we found what is likely the right source), we contacted Daryl to ask a few follow-up questions, planning to hire him.  I must have given him the (totally incorrect) impression that other contractors were standing by to do the work for us, because his brief response was that he was busy and must pass on our job.  \"I'm sure the people providing you with this information will be more than happy to take care of you\", he replied.

Do I have to ask for every thing? Do I ask for hash browns when it says it comes with it? There is a problem every other time I go in this Dennys. I've had sausage that was frozen inside. I gave it 3 stars for the times that the service was good. I've been coming to this location for about 3 years and I've seen a decline in service.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

If so this is your place!!!\n\nI am a mechanic and while on a long distance road trip I needed my rear brakes done.  Since I did not have my tools with me I had no choice.  When dropping off the car I asked for them to retain any parts that were replaced so I could look at them because I know mechanics make their money by replacing parts that don't need to be replaced.  \n\nGuess what???  These \"buggers\" did exactly that!!!  They replaced both the rear rotors (discs) that did not need replacing.\n\nThey said over the phone \"the rotors mic'ed (micrometer measurement) out less and show .010 less than minimum tolerance\"  Since I was not there to verify I believed them.\n\nWhen I picked up the car I visually looked at the old rotors and they looked to be \"turn-able\" (can be machined to return to serviceable condition).  I pointed out that cast into the rotor is the words  \"Minimum thickness .072 inches\"  I asked for their micrometer and mic'ed out the discs and verified that the lowest thickness of the wear on the \"worst of the two\" disc was only .78 inches.  The other one was even thicker... so this means that BOTH DISCS were still within tolerance and could be machined.\n\nSo why did they lie to me when they said \"the discs were .10 less than minimum tolerance\" when they were still serviceable?\n\nBecause they are a RIP OFF and are LI ARS and they take YOUR MONEY by replacing your parts that do not need to be replaced!!!\n\nSTAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!!!!","useful":5,"funny":3,"cool":1}

We called again and he said that they couldn't find our car keys. We were very upset and went to talk with them about it but no one was there. We looked under the rock where we had left them because we had left it there when they were closed, and the keys were still there and had not ever been moved. He had not ever looked at our car and lied about the whole thing, keeping our car from us that whole time. We took the car without ever talking to him about it and he never called to tell us that it was missing. We took it next door to A and B motors and it was a simple problem and had it back in one day.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":2}

My stay in early April was pleasant enough, but not special enough that I would stay at the property in the future or recommend it to others. \n\nPublic facilities: The main lobby and Spa Tower seem to be in better shape than the Palm Tower where my room was located. Nothing that evoked \"ooohs and aaahs\" but nice enough. There were parts of the common areas that were dated and could use updating as was apparent in the Palm Tower. One thing that another poster mentioned that I also found to be odd was the lack of any hotel staff in the Palm Tower. During my 3 night stay I think I saw someone at the desk one evening but that was it. To have to walk through the smoky casino to the main lobby to talk to a hotel staff member was just weird to me. The grounds are nicely kept and while the weather during my stay was less than desirable, the pool area looked nice, too. The parking (valet and self) is free and plentiful so if you have a rental, that's a perk.  \n\nRooms: I will say the room\/bathroom are really large. Having a foyer like entrance, large spaces, a walk in closet, seating, and a door to open to the outside (though an obstructed view)  I liked having space to spread out and a nice walk in closet to store my things (along with a safe). The bed was a bit on the lumpy side though and I did find is difficult to get comfortable. The bathroom Jacuzzi tub was nice and I liked the layout, counter space, and robes too. The one thing that I found strange was the lack of a place to put things in the shower. Strange to have no shelf so I just put my bottles on the floor of the shower.\n\nOnsite restaurants\/room service: While staying on property I tried the Promenade Cafe for lunch (sub par), Irish Pub for drinks\/apps (decent), Starbucks for morning coffee (good), and room service for breakfast (good). Nothing stands out as being amazing but it was definitely nice to have a coffee option. The fees associated with room service seemed higher than most places I have stayed recently but it was a treat and provided me with a nice chunk of \"me\" time. \n\nSpa: See review on Spa Aquae's Yelp page. \n\nLocation: Yes it's 20 minutes to the Strip but for someone who has already stayed on the Strip in the past, I don't feel like I missed out at all. It's actually nice being on the outskirts and seeing the views around the hotel was a pleasant experience. I did have a rental car so I was able to come and go as I pleased and not have to rely on any taxis or shuttle services. \n\nBottom line: Would I stay again? Probably not. There are so many other places to stay in the area that I would want to try someplace new and more updated for the price you pay.","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":1}

We stayed for 3 days and 2 nights which was ~$300. But once you check-in its additional $50 per night deposit fee they charge on the card you used to booked the hotel with. So actually at the end of the stay my total card was charged $400. But after 5-7 days I was reimbursed the $50 per night, so $100. I wouldn't recommend staying here if you plan on staying for more than 3 days. I also heard from one of the hotel guest instead of charging the $50 per night deposit at check-in you can give $200 cash for whatever nights you are staying  and when you check out you get the $200 cash right away. \n\n\nThere's also check-in\/out kiosk.

I work in the restaurant industry so it usually takes a lot of wrongs for me to think service sucks. Upon arrival not more than 10 tables in the entire restaurant and got sat promptly. After 4 minutes of server (Tara) not even stopping by to greet us, I asked the first person who walked by (happen to be the manager) if we could get a server to offer us drinks. He took our drink order and she finally rolled up right before he delivered the drinks. We were ready to order so she took our order and for as slow as it was it took 26 minutes for our food to come out. She asked if we needed anything and we said no, but after a few bites into our meal we noticed my son didn't have all the condiments that came with his fajita dish so we waited a bit, then looked around and saw one server tending to her tables and our server nowhere to be found. I asked the other server in passing if she could get our server but instead she offered to get the missing condiments. As always server came by just a little to late. After finishing our meal I was looking around at an even slower restaurant with fewer tables and our server nowhere to be found again. Went up to the cashier, paid the bill and of course as we were leaving here came the server always a minute behind. Not sure if she was doing side work, eating, taking a break or just hiding but it's sad that every time I looked around the restaurant she was almost nowhere to be seen.

It's amazing how with every patient they kind of have a check list of the same questions and although repetitive you never heard it in their tone. Instead they always sounded respectful and concerned while going through the process. They were helpful in answering all our questions and left us satisfied in sending off our son for his surgery.

Atmosphere is like a small family restaurant,  low-key and relaxed.  As a family of 3 we usually do a 3 combo meal (2 orders of spare ribs and 1 order beef brisket and the 2 sides baked beans and potato salad). Never fails that the spare ribs are always soft and easily fall off the bone.  The meat is so tender and flavorful perfect for me.  My husband and son love sauce and will usually add more barbecue or hot sauce for themselves. The beef brisket is always tender and never chewy where you can't get it down. This usually fills us up,  if we have a bigger appetite we might order more beef brisket or the barbecue chicken.  Sometimes they have special sides like the dirty rice which my family love. We usually visit on Sundays for some barbecue and Ricky is always there to help take care of us.","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":1}

They finally started to send me my bill in the mail so I could see it and pay it. Now, I can't access Contour online for the same reason; I can't login..... and there's more. The Contour voice command seldom works unless you unplug the box and let it reset. The whole system will shut down at anytime, reboot itself, and come back on. It will also freeze and do the same thing. Coming back on can take 5, 10, 15 minutes, whatever. They also require you to have a landline to get a lower price. I have a landline that I have no use for - I don't even know what the number is and there is no telephone attached to it - because I got a lower price if I took it. I have shown the tech guys - who show up every now and then -  features they were unaware of. I could relate lots of stories of bumbling, ineptness, and just plain old \"they don't have a clue about what what's going on.\" But, there is something that I do like.

Matt Melone was incredible and his manager Mike Jameson too.  \n\nI flew to Arizona from Colorado to purchase a used Toyota Tacoma truck from Matt Melone.  Matt picked me up from the airport in the new truck.  It was a warm day and when I went to put up the air conditioner, it didn't function properly, it just blew air.   Immediately upon getting back to the dealership everyone went into high gear to fix the problem.  Matt took me to go get something to eat, and took care of the bill.  They ended up replacing a whole part, which couldn't be done until the following day, but they paid for a hotel room for me and offered to pay any expenses I might have, and they made sure I had breakfast.  They also provided me with a loaner car.   They even went so far as to pay for my hotel room in Flagstaff and offered to pay for my dinner too, that next night on my way back to Colorado.  They also reduced the purchase price to help us even further!  The reduction helped pay for my plane ticket out there, which was a wonderful and exceptionally thoughtful consideration.\n\nThey truly bent over backwards for me, and what could have been a complete nightmare, they did everything in their power to make it not so.   I saw that this dealership has had negative reviews in the past.  I asked Matt about this and he said that they have let go of everyone from the top to the down that was responsible for the poor running of the dealership.  New people have been brought in and they are determined to make this a great dealership.  This was exceedingly evident.\n\nWe need to get another car in the next few months, and we will be calling Matt Melone to help us find one.  It would be a pleasure to work with them again.

We finally had to buy a locked gas cap. The cap was stolen twice. \n-The police & firetrucks have showed up 3 times since we have lived here. It's only been a couple of months.\n-Recently, they lost our rent money. Thankfully, we kept proof that we paid on the 1st. We received an eviction notice and were very confused. \n\n**Most of my negative feelings about this place are because of the tenants that live here. It's not really management's fault.

The barber also gave me a couple of tips on what to do with my hair, which my barber at home has never bothered to mention.

Some of the numbers were just too silly to enjoy but there were a handful that were amazing.  The new 19-year old they are making such a big deal of because she was a playboy centerfold was one of the weakest points - she's not much of a dancer so her pieces are meant to showcase how hot she is rolling around on stuff.  She IS cute - but those pieces were a total yawner.    My biggest complaint is actually about the facility.  HORRID seating (the chairs are about a 1\/2 inch from each other - no leg room at all) and MGM clearly wants to gouge the heck out of you.   A plain old iced tea was $5 and beer started at something like $8 for a bottle of Bud.   Don't believe them when they tell you that you need to get there early - they just want you to get thirsty enough for an $8 Bud to make sense.

I saw a woman in Whole Foods one day who had a really cool and hip short cut, and boldly asked her who cut her hair. She said 'I'm a hairdresser,' and instantly my connection with Christian was born. \n\nI have just read the other stellar reviews of Christian on this site, and found myself nodding and smiling in agreement with all of them. I will add that I have never in my life had a hairdresser who was so caring and concerned about understanding what I want for my hair, then working to give it to me and 'get it right.' Christian is a beautiful person, inside and out, and I feel as if my appoinments with her are also  visits with a friend. \n\nNot to mention that she is a kick-ass, super-talented stylist and my hair has never looked better! I was leaving the salon the other day after Christian did my hair and the next customer commented that I looked 'really hot!\" Now that is the kind of compliment you want to hear after just having your hair done (especially when you're in your 50's!)

Much of it stems from the fact that these apartments were built in the late 80's \/ early 90's and haven't kept up with the times. My apartment had a leaky A\/C unit which would freeze up and drip down onto the carpet. That's exactly what you want during Arizona summers. I changed my air filter often, but the air vents are old and dirty and made me have respiratory problems. Management loves to provide little input or real change and instead just sends the maintenance guys who are able to do little to nothing for these old, troubled rental units.\n\nBesides the units themselves, as I mentioned you'll get problems from management to add to it. Nothing topped off a day at work like coming home to see a note on my door that our entire building will have the water shutoff tomorrow starting at 5am until 5pm. I think this is just a little bit of short notice in the instance of \"routine maintenance.\" I recall this happened at least three times, and once was actually due to the old pipes freezing up during a cold winter. Then when it came time to move out, it was a hassle and negotiation for my full deposit to be returned when it was due to existing problems, and they're making zero investment to renovate and remodel these old apartments. \n\nI understand you want to be near Old Town, but you can do better.","useful":9,"funny":0,"cool":1}

The food was good, and the staff was efficient and served promptly and hot. It is possible to get some variability in the freshness of the food and cleanliness of the location of course, and on both points this location was great.\n\nThe only reason I'm adding my review here, since I don't think every single Chipotle needs a review, is that it was one of my best meals in Vegas. The last time I was in Vegas it seemed a little easier to find something vegan.

My wife's filet (ordered rare) was medium-rare at the thicker end of the cut --yes, a filet with a thicker end-- and was medium\/medium-well at the thinner end. This imparted a chalky mouthfeel to what should have been a silky cut of beef.\n\nMy steak was served with fries, though I asked for the truffle-parm fries. The fries were a sad portion, with a few full-length fries that were cooked right, and the rest of the portion looked like the leftovers from the bottom of the fry-basket --short and burnt. The truffle oil was applied too liberally and smelled almost scorched. My wife's steak was served with yukon gold mashed in a cast iron skillet, and they were moist and delicious. Would recommend the potatoes to other patrons.\n\nI had opportunity to try the dessert paired with the prix-fixe vegetarian meal, which was a chocolate-and-berries cup with whipped cream. The cream was delicious and a great pairing in general, though the chocolate hunks should have been cut smaller - they were three-bite size.\n\nI imagine that you can have a delicious meal at Zink, but when you're not precise with temperature, lack delicacy with seasoning, and are missing some small but noticeable details, it shows. If I were to return I would stick to easy-to-execute and more forgiving dishes like a burger.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0}

Consistently quick with bringing food to the table, clearing dishes, and taking drink orders. Great waitstaff are great for NOT being noteworthy, they just make the meal progress and everything happens at the right time, with very little fuss.\n\nThe pies are excellent, try the special-white (ricotta, pesto, sundried tomatoes), and the plate of meatballs as an appetizer.

{"review_id":"3bKvxeQx9r5f7znEjyBD2w","user_id":"NaORI-qPPhej_Ce_sRH2Iw","business_id":"yIBeZebnXb-hvexqknnDCg","stars":5,"date":"2014-04-04","text":"Last night my wife and I enjoyed a nine-course tasting menu, and I had the best crab cake, salad, salmon, steak, and cheesecake I've ever eaten - all in one meal.\n\nOur meal started with a crab-cake and a small crab salad (with dill, apple, and celery). The crab cake was so warm and fell apart beautifully, perfect spicing, a little n'orleans remoulade underneath, and the lump crab was so sweet and tender. The salad was rich and creamy, a few bites of decadence.\n\nWe then had an artichoke bisque, which was unfortunately the low point of the meal for both of us as neither of us loves artichoke much. The base of the soup was fantastic, but the tough bits of artichoke were just okay, and the cracked pepper garnishing the dish was very coarse ground (which provided contrast to the consistency of the soup, but seemed out of place).\n\nThen on to a baby wedge salad, mine with blue cheese and buttermilk, Barb's with a housemade vinaigrette. The salad was composed with perfect bacon, dried bing cherries, spiced pecans, the blue was fragrant without being overwhelming. Barb's vinaigrette had so much body and cling, with such great balance that she couldn't stop making pleasant-eating-noises - you know the ones.\n\nWe had a little sorbet (blackberry, such concentration of fruit flavor), and then the three main courses.\n\nThe salmon was served with wilted spinach and a potato hash, but the salmon itself was cooked to a perfect and consistent temperature throughout without overcooking the edges, or a slightly-underdone-center. It had a gently spiced rock-hard crust on one side, with perfectly cooked salmon immediately below. The plate was served with a smooth and tangy lemon beurre blanc. Best salmon I've ever had.\n\nNext was the duck course, our server Johnathan mentioned reminded him of Christmas. Beautiful rare duck breast, served on a bed of whipped sweet potatoes (perfectly smooth, none of that stringyness you sometimes get with sweet potatoes) that had been flavored with vanilla and brown sugar. Not overly sweet but absolutely decadent, and a small serving of sauteed brussel sprouts. The richness of the duck offset the cabbagyness of the sprouts, and the sweetness of the potatoes was a great offset to that pair. On top was a single sage leaf - the most fragrant I've ever smelled - which tied it all together and made it feel like christmas.\n\nThe third entree was the filet mignon, what Barb would have chosen, had we only had one choice of entree. Served rare to mid-rare, it had the same amazing cookery as the salmon, where the temperature and doneness was consistent throughout to almost within a millimeter of the soft crust. Served with a green peppercorn sauce, by far my favorite sauce of the night, which had spiciness and richness. The mashed potatoes served with the filet were nothing much on their own, but served as a perfect vehicle for the sauce, and the braised collards were noteworthy for both their balanced flavor as well as the fact that they were perfectly cooked. The greens had little snap in the backbone, they weren't wilted as so many collards become. They were barb's first bite off the plate, and made her eyes light up and she was almost rushing me to try a bite. The steak itself was pure silk on a plate. Warm, lucious, flavorful (uncommon for a filet!). Unfortunately, I do think that Barb's half of the filet was slightly more cooked, and came out mid-rare\/medium, but mine was perfect.\n\nNext, a small goat-cheese log stuffed with dried fruit, rolled in crushed nuts, and served with two pieces of baguette. The baguette had a wonderful quality of being crisp and light (like melba toast, but not as dry), without having a crust that was so hard as to be painful to the gums (as so many toasted baguettes do). Also on the plate were a few tiny slices of celery, and a small drop of wildflower honey. This is not your store-bought-in-a-bear-squeezy honey, but rather it was fragrant and flavourful, very sweet, and brought out a dessertlike quality to the cheese\/nut\/fruit\/bread combination. Barb, I'm sure, would go to great lengths to find that honey again, she enjoyed it so much.\n\nLastly, the cheesecake course. When it arrived, it was small, and we both looked at eachother and said \"this is how cheesecake should be served\", not a huge slab that's a chore to work through, but a small indulgence at the end of the meal. It was rich, but fluffy, and so moist. None of that powdery or clumpy feel that you get at a factory. Served with a bourbon-vanilla-cream sauce on the plate. The sauce was sweet, complex, but not cloying. The cheesecake was sweet and rich, and I mopped that plate clean. But the whole course was never too much of anything, it was just a perfectly walked tight-rope, never too sweet or too rich, never too moist or too dry, but everything was executed wonderfully.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I think 2.5 would be a fair and accurate rating to give but 2 is my only option here. \nYelp considers 2 to be \"Meh. I've experience better\" what a great way to sum this place up.\n\nOur first two negative experiences happened at check in, the receptionist were nice, some of them were hard to understand but I don't think it was any fault of there's, more age related. Anyways we got our key card and proceeded upstairs to our non-smoking room. I swear, i've walked into some rooms that might have a \"faint\" smell of cigarettes, but this 1st room was as if someone took cartons of cigarettes, put them in the middle of the room and little them all on fire before throwing them out the window just as we walked in. We both were sick with colds so could not stand the stench. We walked downstairs again and politely told the front desk what happened. She apologized and said they were trying to fix this issue (it must happen a lot) but at least they are trying to fix it. Okay fine, second times a charm, we quickly are handed a new set of keys with a different room to test out.\nOur second room smells fine, and we quickly get excited, but it was short lived as we try to turn on the lights and soon realize that not a single light switch works, including the bathroom. At this point i'm viewing the hotel as a hike to and from the front desk and consider activating my step counter.\nOur 3rd visit to the desk we are polite again and explain what happened in this room, the women now seems amazed (maybe most people give up by the 3rd try?). So she quickly walks away and mumbles something about manager, she is being nice, i honestly cannot understand what she says though. I look at my female friend for a translation and she shrugs and mumbles manager in recognition of all i understood. \nOkay so the manager comes out and starts typing a novel on the keyboard and apologizing, he is also very nice and courteous, he helped us with 1 night resort fee which we definitely appreciated and moved us into our 3rd and hopefully final room.\nUpon entering our 3rd room everything is in order, smells, electricity, running water... so i'm happy camper, my female friend collapses into the bed in exhaustion from our hike in zion park and now in Circus Circus. \nDay 1 complete at Circus Circus... why is the clown so scary looking?\n\nDay 2\nGoes fine, the building doesn't explode but watch out for the toilets, they flush so hard i swear they could suck your arm down with it. Okay not really, but they will surprise you if you're not ready for it.\nSo it's 10pm, (12\/17) I tell my friend we should watch a movie, she shrugs without thought while staring at an ipad. I think she knows i'm tempting fate at this point.. \nI click the menu and it tells me to call the front desk for movies. Okay...that's a little outdated but sure. I pickup the phone and make the call, front desk doesn't answer, instead it is the operator, who tries to connect me again... no luck, so she tells me they will call me back in a minute. I wait 5 minutes and call back, she tells me they haven't forgotten about me and hangs up again. I wait 30 minutes and call back, reminding her it has now been over 30 minutes, she apologizes and says she will personally go check on why the hotel wont accept my money for a movie (not those exact words, but seriously..) I wait another 30 minutes and start writing this review. I have now been waiting 1 hour and 15 minutes including the writing of this review.. I'm not one to give up but honestly.

Upon approaching the Oyster Bar inside the Palace Station Casino you could smell the cajun spices and heat in the air.. just follow your nose! Fortunately there were only 3 people in front of us at 4pm on a Wed, so we only waited approx 15-20 mind for seats. Upon sitting down you can see the authentic kettles and masses of incredible seafood being prepared deftly by one chef. Lobster, crab, mussels, clam, brandy, garlic - ever delicious Cajun ingredient being expertly boiled, simmered, seasoned and prepared to perfection. I have only had seafood as flavorful as this on my one trip to New Orleans. Though we didn't have the oysters, they were being shucked right in front of us and they looked SO incredible! Huge and plump and looking so fresh, we will definitely be ordering a dozen to share next time! \nI had the combo pan roast level 6 of spiciness and JJ, the chef that prepared our food, cooked and spiced it to perfection.  It definitely had a kick and every piece of seafood was cooked perfectly - lobster, shrimp and crab. My girlfriend had the shrimp and lobster fra diavolo and it was spicy, brothy, and delicious. The pasta seemed very fresh and drank in the smoky, spicy broth amazingly.  The portions were huge and we left with enough food to eat for at least a meal or two later.  If you aren't grumpy hungry and are willing to wait a little while for genuine flavors and quality this is the place to go!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

You can taste the homemade authenticity and care that goes into the preparation of each boli. Four Kegs is a bit of a dive, with only about ten tables but with food like this you will definitely want to venture away from the buffets and pricey fare of the Strip.\n\nEqually as amazing as the food was the cheery and friendly service we received from Kelly. She was sweet, knowledgeable,  helpful and fun! She made the experience even better by cracking jokes and just being relatable and friendly.  We left feeling like friends and definitely will be back next time we're visiting Vegas.

Really hope it doesn't go out of business. Definitely a \"hidden\" gem. Great service. Met the GM - he was super friendly and welcoming. Our server was upbeat, pleasant and answered all of our questions. They have an amazing happy hour. Half off apps and great drink specials. Their house margarita (on the rocks with salt) is deceivingly strong and delicious. They have the only tequila tap in the United States!!Their apps are awesome. The wild mushroom tamale is ridiculous. Highly recommend. The ceviche is amazing especially if you're a fan of lime. And their carne asada plates are impressive.

The starters were shrimp wrapped in a taquito-like shell, and a mango salad.  I enjoyed the shrimp, but I found the mango salad was too sweet to be a good appetizer.  For the mains my companion and I ordered a tofu curry and chicken in a cashew sauce with noodles, respectively.  \n\nNothing unusually striking with my chicken dish.  The flavor was quite acceptable and portion size was good.  My companion didn't have any complaints about the curry dish, and she even brought home the leftovers.  Dessert consisted of two pieces of fried banana and a scoop of coconut ice cream.  Both were quite appealing, though I accidentally got some of the fried banana syrup on my finger.  The syrup was incredibly sticky and I had to wash it off at a sink as merely using a napkin was not enough.\n\nThe dining area is small (under 10 tables), and the service was excellent.

I opted to consult a naturopathic doctor and same thing happened. I almost lost hope until I found this clinic. I went there for a consultation and the consultant did a visual analysis of my scalp to find out if my follicle is still active or not. He was very informative and detailed as he knew that I am very anxious about my condition. After the assessment he advised me to do the treatment and I quickly signed up for everything that he offered although I dont know if this will help me or not. I am so desperate at that time but he make me feel at ease.\n\n4months after I started the program to my delight, my hair loss stopped and I started noticing some regrowth. I didn't expected such a short time I will notice the difference. He again did the follow up and suggested to do the PRP which I decided to go right away as he is the guy that don't lie but only look after the best for you.

There seems to be some negative buzz surrounding this place. Most of the stuff I read made it seem like there wasn't any shot of much good coming out of it. So, imagine my surprise when the food was good, the service was attentive, and the overall experience was one that I'd come back for.\n\nIn all fairness, a lot of that negative stuff I read was about their Theatre district location on King West, which I've neer been to, but that just doesn't hold much value for me. The fact is, most of those places on that strip of King seem to get a bad rap. Get 'em in, get 'em fed, get 'em out; that's their philosophy as they wait for theatre goers to arrive, and then again when they hope for them to come back after the show... thankfully, Hey Lucy's Annex location isn't anything like that.\n\nWith their soft lighting, chandeliers and black-and-white cow print seats, it's difficult to describe what exactly they were going for when they designed this place, but somehow, it works well and provides a nice backdrop, particularly for a date night. The ambience is hip, the decor is comfortable and cozy, and the space is of a decent enough size that it can easily accommodate both large groups and couples.\n\nHey Lucy is busy in the summer evenings, mostly because of their killer patio that lines the entire side of the building. Perfect for people-watching, this packed space is a nice addition to The Annex, and it holds up well against other patios on the street (except for Pauper's Pub!).\n\nProbably what Hey Lucy is most well-known for is their martinis. They've got a pretty decent martini menu with some interesting things on it, like the Godzilla and the Freedom 55, but man, these guys are expensive. Although they do come with a minimum of 2 ounces of booze, you can expect to shell out 9 bucks plus taxes for one. And while that may seem ok at first, having a few of them can easily add up... trust me on that. If martinis are your thing, but getting ripped off for them isn't, then you're definitely going to want to come back on a Wednesday. Wednesday is Martini Wednesday at Hey Lucy, and the prices drop to 4 bucks for the exact same martinis. But come early, other people like a good deal when they see one too, and this place fills up pretty quickly.\n\nTheir menu doesn't follow any sort of style; it's a bit all over the place, but it's still the sorta thing you might expect from a place like this. Pastas, wood-fired pizzas, paninis, sandwiches, all of it is pretty good, but unfortunately, this can unexpectedly change once the place fills up. In Hey Lucy's case, it's better to go when it isn't that busy.\n\nWhile I wouldn't go out of my way to go to Hey Lucy, if you're in the area and looking for a night out, Hey Lucy provides nicely.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Between the personal recommendations and the fawning of the print and online food community, the decision wasn't too hard to make to try it out. (The fact that it was voted one of the best new restaurants of 2011 by Toronto Life definitely didn't hurt.)\n\nWe popped into Kalendar for a drink beforehand (check out the rojo martini if you go. Most excellent.) and watched the world go by, including the chef of Grace, Top Chef Canada contestant Dustin Gallagher. Mental note: must get to Grace! We wandered over to Woodlot and as soon as we opened the door, the aroma from that spectacular wood-burning oven wafted over us. Figuring that was a good sign, we inhaled deeply and sat down at our cozy table. The restaurant looks like it seats about 50 on the upper floor with room for another 10 or so downstairs at the chef's table. The exposed brick walls are adorned with native Canadian art as well as knickknacks that lend a cottage-like vibe to the place. The waiters are dressed casually and it is explained to us that there is a standard menu, plus a separate vegetarian menu. I perused it quickly and was impressed to find a nice selection that didn't fit into the standard roast-veg-or-pasta options.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of cabernet franc and eventually settled on three courses: the scallop ceviche with black quinoa, whipped avocado and julienned red cabbage; Red Fife whole wheat papardelle with wood mushrooms and hazeluts; whey-fed pork chop with grilled treviso, tri-tip steak with caramelized onions and side of Jerusalem artichokes.\n\nWhen the bread basket arrived at the table after placing our order, we jumped right in. My dining companion loves bread and watching his face light up after taking that first bite of the gorgeous Red Fife bread was wonderful! I'd read about this particular grain in Sara Elton's book, Locavore, and was excited to check it out. It kind of makes regular bread taste entirely pathetic. We'd both had a couple of pieces of the various kinds when the appetizer arrived. The scallops were soft, the avocado was whipped into a lovely, airy bubble and these textures were complimented well with the crunchy quinoa and cabbage. I wish there'd been more of it, but we weren't exactly going to starve.\n\nNext up was the papardelle which was out of this world. Again, the Red Fife made a huge difference in terms of flavour. The wide, handmade noodles were cooked perfectly and provided much more dimension to the dish than you'd have otherwise. It was a very earthy plate, one that you wanted to hunker down with in front of a fire and never stop eating. I hope that's on the menu year 'round, because I would have it again and again.\n\nThe service at Woodlot is quite good, if not entirely exceptional. Importantly, however, they let you enjoy your meal in peace and the timing in between courses is well paced. We needed a little time between the hearty pasta and giant slabs of meat that would imminently arrive at our table. And giant slabs of meat they were: delicious, juicy, perfectly-cooked pieces of meat. My pork chops had that little layer of fat around the outside that you know you probably shouldn't eat, but can't help yourself because you know how good it is. The grilled treviso was a perfect compliment, too. The steak was exactly medium-rare as  ordered and was incredibly tender. The caramelized onions were an excellent accompaniment - in fact, I'd eat a whole bowl of those if they sold them. Even the Jerusalem artichokes were great - caramelized and not overcooked.\n\nTo say that we savoured every bite is not an understatement. Nothing was complicated (though I have a spot in my heart for complex food) or overwrought: in fact, we saw several dishes come out on wooden cutting boards. Dessert was very tempting, but we passed this time. I'd like to go back in the cooler months as I'm dying to try the marrow-infused whipped potatoes.  Of course, I also want to go back so I can eat ALL the bread that's there.\n\nSo there you have it. Great food, cozy and welcoming atmosphere. It's tough to get reservations on a weekend, but the hostess with whom I spoke to make our reservations was gracious and as accommodating as could be. I will definitely be making return trips here!","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":1}

They do one thing and do it well: Halal Pakistani cuisine. The space is fairly plain, the decor is mostly barebones, and they've been 'under renovations' for the last few years. Despite that, this place seems to run seamlessly and churns some serious Indian food. Outdoors they have a large patio where the huge indoor space can spill over to in the warmer months once the restaurant gets busy, which it inevitably does. If the seating is full and there's a line at the door, no worries, this place has a great takeout service, which I usually get. Just call ahead, and it's usually piping hot and set for pickup in about 20 minutes.\n\nFlaky with hint of spice and smokiness, Lahore's samosas are better than your average samosas on the Gerrard. But my usual order includes the Vegetable Biryani. It's a huge portion of perfectly cooked Basmati rice, tomaotes, peppers, cauliflower, chickpeas, potatoes, and a mild blend of tumeric, cumin, and chili powder. I also love their Paneer cheese. The squeaky Indian cheese is an unaged curd cheese that is denser than tofu, but seems to absorb flavours just the same.  Lahore serves their Paneer Tikka Masala, and in my opinion, it's the city's best. Lightly seared and tandoor, it's served in a smoky, slightly spicy sauce; it's made the way it should be. And of course, be sure to order a side of their naan bread. Not only is it lightly oiled, seasoned, and softly charred, but it's also perfect for making sure you soak up all of the sauce.\n\nNext time you're looking for some Indian food, forget all those 'all you can eat' buffets and head to Lahore Tikka House on Gerrard East. It sets the bar pretty high for good Indian food in Toronto.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":2}

Say what you will about that corporate beast, but in my opinion, David's Tea has had a firm hand in pushing tea into the hands of mainstream Toronto. So, in a market on its way to becoming pretty heavily saturated, what's Tea Blendz doing to differentiate themselves? Plenty...\n\nFirst off, it's not a corporate beast. It's a little boutique shop owned by Khadija, an incredibly nice person whose passion for all things tea-related is almost contagious. That feeling of non-corporateness runs throughout the experience at Tea Blendz. Khadija is easily approachable, encourages you to ask questions, and is obviously passionate about the stuff she's selling. Not to say that the staff at those corporate places aren't passionate, but at Tea Blendz, it just seemed more honest.\n\nThey also have a pretty kick-ass teaspresso machine--one of the only ones in Toronto right now I'm told. Basically, it allows them to quick-press loose-leaf tea rather then steep it. That means you can get it faster and cleaner, and the whole process is under more control of the brewer rather than being at the mercy of the boiling water. Your tea will still take a few minutes, but those few minutes can easily be spent talking to the warm and pleasant staff. In fact, I ended up staying and chatting about tea and the neighbourhood for far longer than those few minutes that my tea was pressed.\n\nUsing the teaspresso machine, Tea Blendz also brews up some pretty amazing tea lattes. Khadija claimed they were the best in the city, and I can't say I'd disagree with her. While I'm self-admittedly not a tea or tea latte expert by any means, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I could definitely see myself going out of my way to enjoy another one.\n\nKhadija works with local tea blenders to come up with a lot of her blends. They have plenty of classic flavours, like Earl Grey, English Breakfast, and Bourbon Street Vanilla, and some of that are hers and the blenders creation, like Chocolate Mint Delight, Root Beer Rooibos, and Sweet Pumpkin Spice. Despite being pressed and not steeped, the subtle flavours that the tea descriptions promised were still prevalent. I also picked up on a slight sweetness, which amazingly highlighted the even subtler flavours in the tea. All-in-all, I'd sort of equate it to wine-tasting; after tasting it, discussing the tea and its flavours seemed almost natural.\n\nKhadija mentioned that there's a growing trend in food and tea pairing. Because of that, I wondered if she planned on offering any food at some point, which right now she doesn't. I don't mean sitting down and eating a club sandwich and fries, but a small, one-bite of something that was specifically made just to be paired with a particular tea would certainly have been interesting. But Tea Blendz just opened a month ago, so things aren't yet set in stone.\n\nAll-in-all, I had a great chat with Khadija. I learned some stuff, and I even left with a few bags of tea. I brought home a bag of Chocolate Mint Delight and the Sweet Pumpkin Spice, and at 5 bucks for 50 grams, I left feeling pretty good about buying it.\n\nSo if you're in the neighbourhood, this honest-to-goodness, non-corporate boutique shop is definitely worth checking out and supporting. Even if you're not in the neighbourhood, it's worth the drive if you want to learn more about tea and if you appreciate truly nice customer service.","useful":6,"funny":0,"cool":6}

You can still see the CN Tower, but it all seems far removed from the tourist-focused mentality. Preparing food requires creativity and there is no better place for the chefs of Parkette to find artistic inspiration than on Queen West beside Trinity Bellwoods Park.\n\nA very tiny restaurant, Parkette offers an equally small, very succinct menu with starters, second courses, salads, pasta, pizza mains and desserts. The server tells me, \"our dishes are meant to be shared, like family-style,\" and so we did.\n\nA meal for two should typically be made of three dishes; a starter, a salad and a main or a \"second\" and two mains, and so on. They offer, what I would call, up-to-date traditional Italian food. Our starter of mussels in tomato broth, topped with fennel and white beans ($10), was just light enough to leave room for the heavier mains of beef cheeks on bed of polenta ($16) and ricotta gnocchi with oxtail ($14). The beef was tender enough that only a fork was needed to pull the pieces apart and, though not experienced with polenta, I thought it was appropriately soft and that it held up to the rich beef. \n\nAs mentioned in previous reviews, I am a new gnocchi-addict. Parkette's was not so dumpling-like as I've had before and it was certainly not topped with your typical pasta sauce. Little packets of tender potato, assumingly kept so soft by the ricotta, were paired with oxtail and sun-dried tomatoes in more of an aus jus, than a sauce. I think I had a bit more than my fair share of that dish - at a $14 price-point, this was the best of the night. The ingredients are bold, but the layered flavours hold up perfectly. \n\nHumble, but delicious, Parkette offers carefully prepared food in a great atmosphere; natural woods, stemless wine glasses and paper napkins prevent the tiny interior from becoming claustrophobic. Parkette does almost make you feel like you're having a lovely dinner in the park.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The place was packed, and I soon realized that this was not only attributed to its convenient location.  Earl's serves up some seriously good food.\n I'll be totally honest right out of the gate and say that I rarely frequent chain restaurants.  If I do, it's because it's for a birthday or office party where the show of hands wins.  Chain restaurants don't usually sell me on coming back for more.  Earl's did.\n\nWe started with the Tuna Poke Nachos ($11.50).  Served on crispy wontons, and loaded with cubed raw tuna, cucumber, avocado and tomato, they looked like they would be a task to eat.  I envisioned myself taking a bite and (if the toppings made it as far as my mouth without falling off) having it crumble, leaving me with half of a naked nacho, or in this case, wonton.  They surprised me though by maintaining their structure (and toppings).  The spicy mango coulis they were drizzled in leant a nice kick with some crushed macadamia nuts paying tribute to the Hawaiian roots of the dish. I'm not normally a big fan of sushi, but in this case the texture of the tuna and avocado married nicely with the crispiness of the wontons.\n\nNext was the Gnocchi with Italian Rose Sauce ($10.50).  I love gnocchi, but it is associated with being too heavy and too filling often because, well, it usually is.  Not in this case.  Earl's handmade potato gnocchi was the perfect consistency throughout.  Consistent consistency if you will.  And true we shared it, but it was a generous portion and neither of us felt weighted down afterwards.  That wasn't the best part though.  The title of the dish doesn't do it justice.  This gnocchi isn't served in just any ordinary rose sauce... it's served in a rose sauce made of San Marzana tomatoes, burrata cheese and fresh basil.  This, my friends, is the Margharita pizza of gnocchi.  Enough said.\n\nBeing ambitious (see: gluttonous), we welcomed the Pulled Pork Sandwich ($13.50) and Potato & Leek Soup ($7) to our table.  I'll start with the soup...although in reality that wasn't the sequence of events.  The soup was creamy and filled with chunks of potato (skin still on...because that's where all the vitamins are!).  It was good, but let's face it, it didn't compare to the main event of this course.  Even halved, our plates were dwarfed.  This is one behemoth of a sandwich.  Piled with tender BBQ braised pork and coleslaw then dressed with a fiery chipotle mayo, this sandwich was a nice balance of spicy and sweet.  It was messy like it should be so keep the napkins close at hand.  I had almost reached my limit but I knew dessert was on the way, so I exercised some will power (says the girl on her third course) and left a few bites on my plate.  I would be lying if I said I wasn't sad to see it go.\n\nYou might think that by this point we were too full to even consider the possibility of dessert, and by daily caloric standards, we probably should have been.  But we laughed in the face of those standards and pushed onward...onward to Warm Gingerbread Cake ($8).  Rarely do I find myself at a loss for words, but this cake found me there.  It might have had something to do with the fact that my mouth was full of the aforementioned cake, but also because it was really, really good.  I could use a plethora of colourful adjectives to describe this cake (see: heavenly, divine, decadent) but it all feels so cliché, and none of them would do it justice anyway, so I'm sticking with good.  Damn good.  It was served warm (as promised), drizzled with salted caramel sauce and with sides of brown sugar apple slices and vanilla bean gelato.  Now on any given day, I'll take a cookie over a slice of cake, but not on this day (or any day going forward where I'm given the choice between a cookie and this particular cake).  It was impossibly moist and as we ate it we debated about what made it so.  We came to the conclusion that... well, we didn't really come to any conclusion, except that it was killer, and we would be back for more.  Whoever is slicing the cake at Earl's isn't stingy (bless their soul) but that was one plate that went back to the kitchen devoid of crumbs.\n\nNow Earl's isn't the place to go for a quiet date.  The people are loud (because there are a lot of them), and the music is loud (because it fights to be heard over the people), but the food is excellent and the service, equally so.  It's a hike from my house in High Park to the Financial District, but one I'm willing to make again.  Three words folks... warm, gingerbread, cake.  Do yourself a favour.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

It's an exciting feeling that doesn't happen all that often; but, walking into Guu Izakaya on Church St., I was definitely overcome by that thought.  Everyone who enters and exits gets a loud greeting and goodbye from the entire staff. A bit overwhelming, but it certainly sets the tone for your evening. The place is an absolute nuthouse in the best possible way.\n\nThat evening, my two companions and I were lucky enough to get seats within a few minutes upon arriving, a rare feat as I understand it. Guu features communal dining, with long tables that seat around 15 - 20 people, as well as seats at the bar where you can watch the chefs work. There is a two-hour time limit for diners and often a 1-2 hour wait for a seat. If you can, go early or prepare to cool your heels for a while. I promise you that it will be worth it.\n\nMy friends had been to Guu before so they did the bulk of the ordering. They chose the best dishes they'd had before and also took cues from our tablemates who'd ordered some fascinating fare. The menu is set up tapas-style, a fantastic way to sample all sorts of delicious creations. We ordered eight dishes for the three of us which was just about right and all were quite reasonably priced.\n\nThe first to arrive was the decidedly (and awesomely) decadent deep-fried brie served with a mango and blueberry sauce.  The four pyramid-shaped morsels were golden and crispy on the outside and gooey, rich deliciousness on the inside. Like, eyes-rolling-in-the-back-of-your-head-good. Next up: the salmon sashimi. Melt in your mouth greatness. It's one of those simple dishes that really sings based on the merits of great, high quality ingredients.\n\nOn to the bacon-wrapped scallops and enoki mushrooms. Holy. Smokes. Bacon-wrapped anything is a winner in my books but here the contrasting textures played against each other so beautifully. Paired with the salty pork, the sweet scallop and earthy mushrooms, this dish was so good that it was tempting to cancel the rest of our order and have nothing but this for the rest of the night.\n\nThe beef carpaccio was placed before our wide eyes next and it was a lovely, bright contrast to the richness of the dish before. Served with with ponzu, wasabi, mayo & garlic chips, this rare beef was light and, somehow, refreshing. It was nice to have a lighter bite after the richness of the scallops before.\n\nIt was at this point in our meal that I noticed a crowd of waiters pause from their constant, frenetic activity. Then I spotted a server with a slice of cake with a candle in it. Guu's birthday celebrations put Chuck E. Cheese to shame. Not only did the wait staff lead the entire restaurant in a rousing rendition of \"Happy Birthday\", encouraging everyone to clap and sing along, but even the insanely busy chefs joined in. At one point, they had the lights flickering on and off. Utter celebrational pandemonium and it was amazing.\n\nOnce the place had settled down a little (to be clear, Guu is the least settled place on the planet), the strangest creation of the evening appeared at our table. It was roughly the size of a softball, deep fried and had a wooden knife protruding from the centre. We wracked our brains trying to figure out if we had actually ordered it, decided we hadn't and dug in anyway. What it turned out to be was a Japanese scotch egg with a layer of pureed pumpkin surrounding a hard-boiled egg. While I was skeptical initially - I'm not a big pumpkin fan, much to the horror of many of my friends - the combination of the creamy pumpkin, rich egg, crispy exterior and tangy sauce was downright addictive. We just about scraped the plate without chopsticks long after other dishes had been cleared away.\n\nWhen the spare ribs arrived, it was all I could do to refrain from gobbling them all up myself. The marinated beef was tender and salty, having surely been marinated for quite some time. If you're a fan of spare ribs, these are a can't-miss.\n\nThe final dishes of the night were the decadent, baked oysters and the light, miso-glazed black cod. We ordered the oysters because we saw them arrive for another group at our table and they looked so unique! Kind of a twist on oysters Rockefeller, they're served with spinach and mushrooms, smothered in a potent mayo-garlic sauce and topped with melted cheese...all in a giant shell. This was a thing of glorious, messy beauty. The mushrooms nestled in there made for an umami bomb of a bite. Definitely give this one a shot, my friends. It's weird and tasty and I've never seen it anywhere else.\n\nNot only was this one of the best meals I've had all year, it was by far and away the most fun. Unquestionably, the company helped but the atmosphere at Guu is like none other. It's not the place to go for a quiet, intimate dinner; it's the place to go when you want to try innovative, playful and truly remarkable dishes.","useful":4,"funny":2,"cool":4}

The menu is a full three panel - front and back - array of original creations, ranging from the unique and beautiful Lazy Sundaes to the Scoop du Jour - one or two scoops with cream and cherries.  Of course, you can also just select from the many offered toppings and ice cream flavours to create-your-own.  Ice cream includes peanut butter, nutello chocolate (not to be confused with Nutella) and vanilla-honey, amongst others.  On top of that, they throw in a freshly made crepe or waffle, some bananas or strawberries, chocolate sauce and a couple of dollops of the clearly-in-house-made whipped cream, and you have a dessert that will put you in a delightful sugar coma!\n\nIt was close to 11:00 p.m. when I made my way to Demetre's, but there were still a good number of sweet-toothed patrons enjoying some of the sugary creations - this was clearly be more than your regular two-scoop waffle-cone kind of place.  They make all of the ice creams on the premises, using fresh Ontario dairy and utilizing a special freezing process that prevents ice crystals from forming in the carefully crafted artisan frozen treats.\n\nThe servings provide you more than enough ice cream and extras to share comfortably, but my group decided to be gluttonous and each have their own; three ice cream crepe dishes, one with peanut butter ice cream, one nutello chocolate and one with the house chocolate.  The best thing about these desserts, right down to the whipped cream, is the balance of sweetness with the bold flavours.  There is a truly special way they do things that prevents the strong flavours from overwhelming the whole dish.  The peanut butter ice cream was nowhere near that almost sticky consistency and too-rich taste that can be attached to some PB creations; the whipped cream was a clean and creamy compliment to the light chocolate syrup; and the fruit was fresh and surprisingly bright considering the winter months.\n\nI am a self-proclaimed cheap dessert-eater, but here I felt like I got much more than I paid for.  The dishes come in at about $10 each - but, if you're sharing, which is probably more appropriate than polishing off a whole plate alone, it is quite affordable - especially for the top-notch quality.\n\nThe cherry on top was the service.  It was fast, friendly, and appropriately attentive.  A few casual checks were done here and there and an offer for re-fills was made - so simple, but so important.\n\nIf you haven't done so yet, check out Café Demetre. It's a sweet spot to get some sweets.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

It's a custom bakeshop in Bloor West Village that revolves primarily around the cookie. Their website lays out their philosophy best: there is nothing quite like a cookie just out of the oven. That cookie, just out of the oven, and the experience that goes along with its creation, is exactly what Sweet Flour is all about. I say 'revolves primarily around the cookie' because although your perfect cookie is their goal, they don't stop at cookies. Everything from homemade granola to muffin tops and ice cream sandwiches to gingerbread is there for you to claim and customize as your own. For me, Sweet Flour delivers the experience of one of my best-remembered childhood memories: watching cookies bake through the oven window and patiently waiting for them to cool just enough to eat.\n\nSo what exactly does it mean to 'customize' cookies? At Sweet Flour, it means you're in charge of what's getting made. It all starts by picking what you want to bake. You can choose muffin or cookie batter, and from a couple variations of either of those, but your best bet is probably the classic cookie. It's perfectly sweet with hint of vanilla and butter. From there you decide what you want in the cookie; trust me, it won't be an easy decision to make. There are tons of different treats ranging from chunks of chocolate to crunchy nuts to soft dried fruits. You get a choice of two. Then they mix it, form it, and bake it ultra fast. Your cookie is perfectly hot and baked and in your hands in about two minutes.\n\nSweet Flour doesn't just stop at custom cookies. They also cater parties with baked goods, bake and decorate custom cookies for events, do cookiegram deliveries, and even package their cookies into kid's loot bags.\n\nOne thing is made perfectly clear from the minute you walk in until the minute you step out the door; these people care about quality. Everything in use seems fresh and high grade. From the glass bottled locally source milk to the fair-trade coffee to those incredible cookie ingredients, all of it seems to be bought with both quality and you in mind. A rare outlook nowadays when everything seems to be about the bottom line.\n\nThe aspect about Sweet Flour I immediately noticed is that their space has expansion written all over it. I'm sure this is the only one, but the layout, decorating, even the logo, all of it made it feel strangely familiar, like I was somehow used to it. This place definitely screams franchise, and I wouldn't be shocked to eventually see one downtown, at the mall, even at the airport. While that certainly isn't a bad thing for the business, I personally felt as though it sort of takes away from the connection to my childhood feeling.\n\nI know there are a couple more places in Toronto that do the same sort of custom cookie experience that Sweet Flour does, but I'm not sure who did it first. The only thing I can say is that I've been to Sweet Flour twice, and both times it was a pretty good experience from start to finish. However, although the cookie does come out hot, fresh, and made to order, it did cost almost 8 bucks for two of them and a glass of milk. Seems a little steep to me, but as a treat, it's nearly perfect.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1}

While that may have been true a few years ago, boy-oh-boy, the times are changing. Those of us living in the neighbourhood awhile have seen its dynamic (albeit slow) change, particularly when it comes to food; but in the Junction's ever-expanding food landscape, a few places are setting the stage. Enter the Junction Fromagerie.\n\nJunction Fromagerie is sitting non-coincidentally right next to Delight, a chocolate shop that's perhaps known in the neighbourhood more for their ice cream than their handmade chocolate. Both Delight and Junction Fromagerie are brain-childs of the same people, Jennifer Rashleigh & Jeff Brown, and the association is obvious as far as quality goes. While Delight doesn't have any cheese, they do have a uniquely flavoured and way-better-than-it-sounds Quebec blue cheese ice cream. Soft and creamy with an exacting amount of high-quality blue cheese, it's obviously well crafted and surprisingly tasty.\n\nWhat makes the Junction Fromagerie different from the handful of other cheese specialty shops in Toronto is their strict direction to Canadian products; they only carry Canadian cheeses, local and artisanal mind you, but Canadian nonetheless. They're also particularly partial to Ontario cheeses. Their in-house made butter, crackers, and croustinis, in conjunction with those small-batch and locally sourced cheeses, make them a worthy underdog in an increasingly competitive business.\n\nThe Junction Fromagerie brings with it some old-world charm, and at first walk-in, you may mistake it for a boutique fromage on a quiet Paris street. Big-frame bay window and a creaky wood-laid floor set the space. Besides that, the whole store is fairly nondescript other than the front case brightly displaying their cheeses.\n\nDon't know your Comtomme from your Bleu de la Moutonndere? No worries! Not only is the staff knowledgeable and the cheese labeled and explained, but the Junction Fromagerie also offers cheese tastings and pairings that not only teach you about the cheese they carry, but also inspire you to be a bit more adventurous in your cheese selections. Although these tastings aren't a regularly occurring event, they do happen. Their Stone's Throw Cheese and WIne Pairing event, which was created with the folks at Stone's Throw Winery, sold out super quick.\n\nThe appearance of Junction Fromagerie signals more than just beautiful cheese being available in the Junction. It also serves as an important reminder that when it comes to food, the Junction is fast becoming a neighbourhood that is known for quality.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Offering a tapas-style menu full of Spanish dishes, with a hint of Latin American flare, Torito (Spanish for \"little bull\") gives you the opportunity to sample a variety of dishes and flavours, and provides a great atmosphere for sharing with friends.\n\nTorito's dining room is quite small, but has a great look and feel. Spanish pop culture images tastefully adorn the back wall and it has an intimate atmosphere and décor modeled after a traditional Barcelona Tapas bar - having never been, I will have to take their word on that.\n\nAt first glance, two things stood out about the menu; they had so many options for beverages that the wine and drinks section made up for half of their selection (no complaints here), and I did not know what most of the items were - Patatas Whatas?. Thankfully, the knowledgeable staff were more than happy to explain the menu to me.\n\nAlways an advocate for ordering the specials, I began with the Picos and Jamon, thin prosciutto-like ham wrapped around crispy breadsticks, and the Huevos Escoceses, boiled quail eggs battered and fried - quite good!  Following that were the Crab Croquettes and, with the server's recommendation, the Patatas Bravas and Chorizo, or potatoes and spicy sausage.  The Crab Croquettes were perhaps a bit soft for my liking as I do enjoy a bit of crunch, but they were seasoned and plated nicely.  The Patatas Bravas were my kind of \"meat n' potatoes\" - simply delicious!\n\nThe food is flavourful, fresh and clean, and is not hidden behind a barrage of spices and sauces.  Most importantly, it is served in a timely manner.  Torito offers hot and cold tapas, and instead of everything coming out at once to litter the table, it is brought out in a staggered sequence; the cold remain cold, and hot remain hot.\n\nOn my next visit--and I will make my way back--I am definitely ordering the Ceviche.  When it arrived to my neighbouring table, it looked fantastic!  If I can recommend something I did not actually taste, it would be that.  If you have tried it, please comment and let me know the verdict!\n\nA few cautionary items to draw your attention to: the restaurant is open only from 5:00p.m. - 11:00p.m., so it is not a late-night-bite place; there is an 18% gratuity (before tax) applied to parties of six or more (not unusual, but watch out for it); and Torito's spread is not for bargain eaters.  For my party of two, with only one single-serving alcoholic drink each, and a dinner of 4 appetizer-sized plates, it was just over $65 before tip.  That said, there is a difference between dining and eating; and Torito is a dining experience that I am happy I had.\n\nTorito is a \"little bull\" of a restaurant that packs a punch!","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":3}

I had extremely high hopes for this restaurant. As a self-professed Mexican food addict, I could not wait to try this place out. But unfortunately, Margarita's Fiesta was no party at all.\n\nFriday night on Baldwin Street is a lively place with an excess of restaurants, all of them boasting lots of patios, people, music, and conversation; Margarita's is no exception. They have a cozy patio out front, a larger patio on the roof, and tons of colourful umbrellas and luscious plant life. Add in the sounds of the Gypsy Kings, and it's enough to lure anyone in.\n\nThe restaurant is quaint and decorated with traditional Mexican and Peruvian artwork, and the restrooms are an art gallery in and of themselves, a fitting homage to Mexico's own Frida Kahlo and her incredible self-portraits. Sounds fun! I know! But that was where the fun stopped...\n\nWhen we arrived, we were greeted with a grunt, and then pointed to a table on the lower patio. When we asked if we could be seated upstairs, we were told it was closed, only to see guests seated upstairs within the hour. Not a great first impression...\n\nIt took a solid 15 minutes before we saw anyone willing to accept our drink order of a pitcher of sangria ($24), which arrived with more ice than wine, a few apple slices, and little flavour. Ever the optimists though, we decided to overlook those and a few small details, and we were anxious to try the food.\n\nWe decided to start with their 'famous' nacho chips and guacamole, which arrived only minutes after ordering. The quick arrival slightly redeemed the long wait for cold drinks on a hot Friday night, but the fact that plates, or even napkins, were almost impossible to come by brought us back. Apparently, according to our server, cutlery is reserved for the special people that order entrees.\n\nAlmost a half hour later, we were finally allowed to order our mains, after numerous sidelong glances and polite 'excuse mes' to our server. Between the three of us we ordered the Chicken Taco Salad ($12), Chicken Quesadillas ($11) and Vegetarian Enchiladas ($14), each with a side of salad and\/or rice. When our meals finally arrived, they were much smaller than I expected, especially for a Mexican restaurant, which is normally known for their large portions size and abundance of extras like salsa, cilantro, sour cream, hot sauce; none of which found their way to our table.\n\nOur meals were okay, but certainly not noteworthy. The taco salad was crispy and fresh, but lacked the colourful palette of ingredients normally found on a taco salad and was overall, a little bland. The quesadilla was small-one tortilla cut in half-with a meagre side salad and no additional toppings to speak of. The enchilada was a decent sized portion, but swam in so much grease and oil, it was difficult to find the substance of the actual meal, whihc was supposedly green peppers, onions and cheese. Overall, we were really quite disappointed with our drinks and our meal. On top of the unfriendly and snail-like service, I was very underwhelmed by my experience at Margarita's Fiesta.\n\nIf you are looking for a fun, friendly and rewarding Mexican dining experience, be sure to try out Ahora on Dalhousie Street the next time you find yourself in our nation's Capital, which is Ottawa by-the-way;) Until then, I will be on the lookout for a Toronto Mexican restaurant that lives up to what a Mexican restaurant should be.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1}

Having heard a number of things about Zane Caplansky's mission to re-invigorate, or at least continue the waning culture of the deli, I was intrigued.\n\nThe first thing I noticed, besides the tiny vestibule, is the number of framed magazine covers and articles adorning the walls. It is obvious that this place has captured the attention of many reviewers, both far and wide.\n\nThe decor is pure deli. Open all the way back to the meat counter, with requisite white-hatted carver, it is a mixture of banquettes and bare wooden chairs. The walls are covered with kitschy pressed signs advertising everything from chopped liver to catering. Clearly, a lot of work went into making this place feel authentic; like it had been here for 80 years.\n\nOur server was quick to get our drink order and explain the daily soup and what the kitchen was out off. He was back, eager to help, a couple of times before our decisions were made.\n\nWithin moments, he was back with our soup order. The borscht was hearty and thick with shredded cabbage and chunks of meat. It was slightly sweet and full of flavour, with just a hint of tomato. Possibly one of the best borscht's I have had in Toronto. My guest's turkey soup, which happened to be the daily soup special, was interesting to say the least. Everything in the bowl, turkey and vegetables, was shredded very finely. It had a hint of smoke, which left us wondering if they were using yesterday's house smoked turkey breast. It was quite tasty, but completely unexpected.\n\nWith our soups almost done, our server returned with sides of smoked meat poutine. As a second course, it was the perfect size for two to share. The fries were crisp and cooked well. The gravy was more of a ragout of smoked meat and onions, seasoned thoroughly. The only complaint to be had was the small amount of curds.\n\nWith all our bowls cleared away, the mains soon arrived. I opted for a smoked meat sandwich. It arrived with a pickle spear and a small cup of oil and vinegar coleslaw. The meat was moist and well smoked. The fattiness was exactly as I ordered. The sandwich came unadorned with mustard, which was nice as four styles were provided for you to choose. The coleslaw was sweet with a little tang, neither overly vinegary nor oily.\n\nOn the other side of the table, grilled kebabs were ordered. The lamb was cooked perfectly, tender and a beautiful medium rare, with a nice crust, which pleasantly tasted of charcoal. Served with a grilled vegetable medley and side salad, it was quite a large portion. Care should be given, as the kitchen uses metal skewers, which, without warning from the server, turned out to be very hot to touch.\n\nAll in all, it was quite a good meal. Everything the kitchen put forth was prepared with pride. The only real issue was the desserts: a mixed berry crumble and a chocolate bread pudding. Both were incredibly sweet and had their issues with technique. Unfinished, however, the server asked what we thought and immediately offered to find something more appealing when we told him our thoughts. Kudos to the good service.\n\nCaplansky's Delicatessen lived up to the promise. The food is very well prepared and delicious. Coupled with the easy-going, friendly service, I can see myself going back there time and again.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":3}

Whenever you go, it's a different sorta experience.\nIt's not just diversity that makes this a kick-ass experience, the food is also spectacular and truly imaginative.

Make reservations. Since it opened, this place has gotten great buzz for providing authentic, flavourful Thai food. As a result, people from all over the city have been flocking to this casual downtown joint for lunch and dinner. (They also do take out orders.) My friend and I arrived at 6pm on a Thursday and the place was already almost full: tables of two and four, plus the larger tables at the front that could be utilized for larger parties or cafeteria-style seating and the bar were occupied by a mix of couples, friends and colleagues from the surrounding businesses. While we waited to be seated, I noticed a sheet of laminated paper at the host's stand imploring potential, hungry customers to be patient while waiting for a table to become available.\n\n2. Come hungry. Portions are more than reasonable and priced accordingly. We were starving and decided to try a number of dishes and split them between us: cold rolls filled with home-made chicken sausage, lettuce, carrots, mint leaves and Thai basil (Po Pia Pak Sod Gai Yaw); crispy squash fritters (Gra Bong); a curry dish with bell and hot peppers, kaffir lime leaves and the ubiquitous Thai basil (Gaeng Panang); pad Thai; and a house specialty of stir-fried minced beef with holy basil, topped with a fried egg (Pad Gra Pra). We also ordered the only beer available, Singha. Not entirely sure why there is only one, but it's a light, refreshing beer and I had no complaints about it.\n\n3. Temper your expectations. The food at Khao San Road is good, yes,but it was not exemplary. It wasn't bad by any means, but I had very high expectations that were sadly unmet. The exception was the Pad Gra Pra which was very, very good. It's a house specialty so if you go, you might be best to stick with the items on that particular part of the menu. There was nothing wrong with the food in particular; however, after hearing such glowing reviews from both friends and reviews, I was anticipating more.\n\nAdditionally, we found the service lacking. Our order was taken promptly and our first round of drinks appeared in short order. The problems started when food began to arrive at our fairly small table faster than we could eat. I pointed this out to our server who shrugged and kept piling on the plates. Once we had all our food, our server disappeared, a problem on two fronts: we had no room to maneuver and we wanted another round of Singhas. We were able to flag her down eventually and we were served with much reluctance from that point.\n\nKhao San Road is not a bad restaurant by any stretch. The food is better than average but not spectacular. Stick with the house specialties and you'll likely do well. If you're going to go in for a sit-down meal, reservations are a must. Better yet, call ahead for take-out and have a couple of beers ready to go at home.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

She was lovingly cared for, allowed to roam the yard, and fed fresh corn and barley. How do I know? The other day I was going to my neighbourhood grocery store to buy a whole chicken. You know the type of bird I mean. It sits in those refrigerated, glass boxes at the back of the store; the only indication it was ever a chicken at all is the familiar sight of wings and breast meat. As its lifeless body sits there, I can't ever imagine this thing having feathers, breathing, living. Truth be told, buying that chicken is a mostly unceremonious experience that people rarely give a second thought to.\n\nBut something spectacular happened to me that day. I didn't buy that chicken; I didn't even get to the grocery store. On my way there, I noticed the Butcher by Nature storefront, and I felt compelled to check it out and see what all this 'By Nature' business was all about.\n\nButcher by Nature gives life to that lifeless chicken. Much like purchasing pedigree, the butcher and owner, Frank, knew all about my chicken and all the other chickens he was selling for that matter. He knew the farmers personally, and he knew that they were passionate about raising animals. He spoke proudly about the pesticide-free and natural-focused environment the farmers raised their livestock in. Clearly, this is a different kind of eating.\n\nThe shop is fairly small, but truly cozy, and the store is classic with more butchery area than retail shop. The retail area has shelves lined with locally-sourced dry products, like jams and honey, and fridges lined with locally-sourced meat products, like duck and eggs. Butcher by Nature also has a passionate, knowledgeable owner. Actually, forget that last bit; calling Frank knowledgeable is an understatement. The art and science of butchery is seemingly ingrained in his bones. Much like those chicken's proud lineage, Frank was raised to do butchery.\n\nPesticide-free, hormone-void, locally-sourced meats, combined with an experienced owner and a pleasant store-front is what Butcher by Nature is all about. And of course, they're not limited to just chickens. They carry quite a large variety of meat including duck, venison, pork, and beef; all of it butchered and prepared in a bunch of different ways.\nFear not. Eating all this organic natural stuff isn't for just the rich. In fact, most of the products at Butcher by Nature are actually reasonably priced. In most cases, you can expect to pay just a few bucks more than you would at the neighbourhood grocery store. That, combined with the absolute passion surrounding what they carry makes it an easy choice for meat. Even if you're not in the area, Butcher by Nature is worth the trip.\n\nSo, if you think that chickens, or most other animals for that matter, magically end up in refrigerated, glass boxes at the back of a grocery store, then you owe it to yourself to check out Butcher by Nature because when it comes to meat, it's all about where it comes from.","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":2}

Even the menu is printed on a piece of lined paper that remains set on the table on a (mini-sized) clipboard.\n\nSecond, someone here has tapped into that great ordeal; you have already eaten dinner, but the energy spent on socializing has left you feeling a bit ravenous. The problem is that you don't want to go out for a whole second meal. The answer: Snack Bar. The small, inexpensive portions are a perfect pairing with after work drinks (you won't ruin your dinner appetite) or a nightcap (you won't stuff yourself to the point of uncomfortable).  \n\nThird, they understand that \"snack\" to food-lovers means more than grabbing a granola bar or settling for a muffin for satisfaction.  They have nibble-sized some of your favourite late-night snacks, including a grilled hot dog, pork belly on a bun, Jamaican beef patties and pizza pockets at an appetizing price-point of $3 - $6. There are a few other items, like oysters (coming in at $6 - $7) and latkes with gravlax, to give the menu some oomph.\n\nI started with the pork belly on a bun, one of items I saw featured on their website - a delicious crispy pork morsel tucked inside a steamed bun, filled with Asian-inspired flavours (like Hoisin and chili sauces) and some leaves of arugula, making a wonderfully balanced salty treat. \n\nThen, I rounded things off with a grown-up version of the nostalgia-inducing pizza pocket. This is really more likened to a mini-mini-calzone; it's crispy and airy, stuffed with cheese and laid upon a bed of rustic tomato sauce. After the super flavourful pork belly bun this almost seemed bland, but it was perfectly cheesy and the crunch was on-point. My dining partner caved in and got the hot dog - it was smaller than expected, but hit the spot - followed by the Jamaican beef patty. Both were good, but the bun and pocket are a more interesting choice at the Snack Bar. \n\nThe drinks menu is very scant, but I won't sneer at a cold beer. Overall, I think 416 Snack Bar is on its way to being one of those great spots in the city. I'm going to keep my eye on this one - it's something new and unique and, I use the word again, honest. This could prove to be a new favourite for many a food-loving Torontonian.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":2}

That's what Dewey Truong, owner of Chococrepe wants you to know.  Yes, they are paper thin, but they aren't as one dimensional when it comes to their meal potential.  Walking into the Queen West restaurant on a hot summer day, the last thing that I wanted to eat for lunch was a Nutella and chocolate smeared crepe, so it's a good thing there was so much more on the menu.\n \nDon't let the name fool you.  At Chococrepe, the menu is divided into savoury and sweet options.  So yes, they do offer the obligatory Nutella crepe along with a slew of other sinfully sweet creations, but they also have an impressive selection of crepes with fillings usually associated with sandwiches or wraps.\n\nTo start off we had the Pesto ($9.25) which came with egg, mozzarella , pesto and arugula served on a buckwheat crepe.  Now I'm not an eggs anytime of the day person as I lump them into the breakfast only category, so this probably wouldn't be my go to crepe, but it was tasty nevertheless.  The egg was fluffy, the pesto made its presence known without stealing the show, and arugula is never a bad idea. \n\nAll of the savoury menu items come served on buckwheat crepes which are a bit similar to whole wheat wraps in their texture and consistency.  Despite the name though, it's interesting to note that buckwheat is gluten free, so while I can't speak for the filling, the crepe itself is a good option for those who are at least sensitive to gluten.\n\nTo round out our savoury options we tried the Country and the Chipotle Chicken (both $9.25).  The Country comes stuffed with cheddar and punctuated with wood-smoked bacon and caramelized pear.  I'm not even a huge fan of bacon (I know...sorry) but I loved this crepe.  The saltiness of the cheddar, the smokiness of the bacon and the sweetness of the pear blended so nicely into a ménage a trois of flavour. (What?  It's French...like crepes...)\n\nThe Chipotle Chicken though, with a generous amount of tender chicken breast, mozzarella, arugula, and chipotle mayo, might have been the winner, but I like anything that comes served with a side of heat.\n\nAt this point it's fair to say we were beyond full, and I was convinced that yes, crepes could be lunch, but it wouldn't be fair of us to ignore the dessert crepes completely.  So we tried two.  The Berry Banana ($8.75) is the Platonic ideal of a dessert crepe.  Covered with sliced strawberries and bananas, then drizzled with dark and white chocolate, it looks like art (think Jackson Pollock).  This crepe had a nice balance of tart, thanks to the strawberries, and sweet, thanks to everything else. \n\nOur last crepe of the day came in the form of Crunchy Pear ($8.50), also beautiful in design with sliced Bosch pears, a generous sprinkling of crushed almonds, and painted with milk chocolate, it was a bit sweeter than the Berry Banana due in part to the milk chocolate, but won in the texture category.\n\nAll of the dessert crepes here are made with the typical sweetened wheat flour and served open-face which gives diners the artistic license to fold, roll, or just dive in as is.  And it just looks prettier.\n\nOh, and I should mention that all of the crepes are huge, taking up plates that are larger than your average plate.  My suggestion is to bring a friend, or two, and sample multiple crepes like we did.\n\nDid I forget to mention the hot chocolate?  Oh yes, we sampled a couple.  They take their hot chocolate seriously here at Chococrepe.  All flavours are made with melted Valhrona chocolate and you can have your choice of having it made with dark or milk chocolate (and in some cases, white) and with cream or milk. We really wanted to try the popular Fleur de Sel Dulce de Leche made with dark chocolate, but sadly it was unavailable, so we went with the Pumpkin and the Coconut.  The Pumpkin ($5.95) was made with milk chocolate, so as not to overpower the spice and milk instead of its heavier counterpart.  It was tasty, but I would liken it more to a chai latte than a hot chocolate.\nThe Coconut (also $5.95) however, made with white chocolate and cream was something else.  It was rich without being cloyingly sweet and the coconut flavour came through nicely.  I can definitely see myself going back for one of these once the temperature starts to drop, but if you're craving one now, Truong just installed a brand new air-conditioning system that he's very proud of. \n\nI would also be remiss not to comment on the excellent service at Chococrepe.  Truong himself is a living doll, and he goes out of his way to make your experience at Chococrepe a memorable one.  He obviously loves what he is doing, and says that he wants eating at his restaurant to be a comfortable and social experience, not to mention a delicious one.  Check, check, and check.\n\nFootnote:  Why doesn't the saying go \"as flat as a crepe\"?  Let's face it, in comparison, the crepes pancake cousin from the West has a bit of a weight problem.","useful":8,"funny":4,"cool":4}

I am fortunate enough to know what the good stuff - the real stuff - tastes like, and I resent those who do it poorly. It's not difficult food to make, but it takes both time and love to create great Latin American dishes, and it frustrates me when I see melted cheese from a jar smeared on store-bought chips that are passed off as \"Mexican food\" in restaurants. So it was a relief and a thrill to hear that the head chef from The Black Hoof was helming Grand Electric and promised, \"Mexican food, craft beer, brown liquor and loud music.\"\n\nI met my dinner companion across the street at The Mascot at 5:45 and watched as a line started to form outside Grand Electric. The baristas suggested we get ourselves over there before the line up got too long, warning us we'd be eating at 9pm if we didn't get it in gear. We dutifully lined up at 5:50pm behind two parties. Within five minutes the line had extended half a block behind us. At 6:02pm, the doors opened and people flooded inside. We were shown to a table for two and marveled at just how quickly the small space filled up. Tables were gone by 6:05 and the bar was full a minute later. Music blared, servers started making their rounds and Grand Electric was off and running.\n\nThe bar is quite the thing to behold. Bourbon-heavy, it is run by enthusiastic and well-informed staff.  It towers over patrons and is a great focal point for the restaurant. In addition to bourbon, you can try several craft beers including Churchkey and Canucklehead cask ale. Both are excellent, but if you haven't tried a cask ale, you should know it's not carbonated. Don't let that dissuade you from checking it out, though, as it has a fruity and slightly bitter taste. You'll be hooked after your first taste.\n\nThe menu for Grand Electric located at the back of the restaurant on a giant chalkboard. It is split up into appetizers, tacos, specials and dessert. Given the advanced buzz that's been generated, we opted to try as many dishes as possible. We had the guacamole and nachos (an excellent test of a Mexican restaurant's mettle), tuna ceviche, chicken frito appetizers, one of each taco, and in the end, we went for the key lime pie for dessert.\n\nBeers in hand, we eagerly awaited our food which came out surprisingly fast considering the kitchen must have gotten just crushed with all of us arriving at once. First up came the guacamole and chips. The dip was generously salted and had lots of lime juice, essential elements both. Without enough of those two simple ingredients, guacamole falls flat, but this was the best restaurant-made I've ever had (oh, and it comes with a huge serving of light-as-air pork chicharron as a garnish; a great aesthetic touch as it towers over the guacamole & chips). The fresh corn tortilla chips were also both well seasoned and delicious.\n\nA plate of three tacos was delivered to us, and we hung on every word our server said as she explained which taco was which. The first three were the sweet pork belly al pastor with pineapple, the fried queso (cheese) and spicy arbol chicken. It's not that spicy, I promise, especially considering some of the other choices. Of these, the only miss was the queso which I thought could have benefited from some salt. Having said that, the other two were simply wonderful, especially the pork belly.  We also tried the Baja fish taco, a lightly breaded tilapia fillet topped with bright, fresh cabbage. The textures of the soft tortilla and the crunchy, crispy toppings had us grinning from ear to ear.\n\nNot-to-be-forgotten is the chicken frito dish we ordered: a mound of crispy, fried chicken pieces slathered in a sweet and citrus-y coating and sprinkled with healthy doses of cilantro, jalapeno peppers slices and little, red, evil chile peppers. I like heat, but skipped over the red chiles in favor of the jalapenos. Sweet, sour, spicy, juicy, crispy, hot...there was nothing about this dish that should be changed. Ever. I will most definitely be ordering this one again.\n\nOverall, this was one of the most fun and delicious meals I've had in Toronto. The atmosphere is supercharged in the restaurant, filled with happy customers taking pictures of and devouring the food coming out of the kitchen. While you can hardly say that each dish on the menu is truly, authentically Mexican, it hardly matters when it's this good. A word to the wise: go early or you will be waiting for hours for a seat, but even if you do end up waiting, it'll be worth it. There is no other place in the city putting out food like this.","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":2}

I guess they should. They tout themselves as being Toronto's first onsite roastery--since 1988. Despite all that time, it's not a colossal roasting operation. In fact, it's a small machine in the front window of the shop, but that's part of the appeal of this place: fair-trade coffee roasted onsite, in small batches, right in front of your eyes.\n\nAs it becomes available, Coffee Tree scrawls all of their different roasts and blends of contrasting kinds of beans on a chalkboard near the front entrance. Some of these blends and roasts change from time-to-time; others are Coffee Tree's signatures. On any given day, you can expect to find Casa Primi, Sensuous Morning, Tuscany, and Millionaire's Mixture; some of their well-known signatures. Other days, you can find blends that have been created exclusively for the week or month.\n\nRegardless of what you choose, this coffee is superb, roasted perfectly, and balanced. Sip it slowly, and you'll definitely find complexity. There's the perfect blend of sweet and savoury and none of the unpleasant bitterness you'd expect from other coffee shop brews.\n\nBut it ain't all coffee at Coffee Tree. They've got a surprisingly detailed food menu, considering it's a coffee joint. From breakfast, lunch, and dinner, to French toast, sandwiches, and empanadas, they've got something for whatever time of day you go. They've also got a chilled dessert fridge featuring in-house made desserts, which includes what they call--and I'm inclined to agree--the World's Best Carrot cake. If you're there, give it an unregrettable try.\n\nThe shop layout is the typical long narrow space of most Toronto street-level businesses, and unfortunately, their furniture and decorating ideas aren't much of a help. Despite having unforgettable coffee, the space makes the experience of drinking it feel closed off.  They do, however, support local art by featuring a local artist's work on their walls for sale, and that certainly is a plus, but when I was there, the art wasn't something I was particularly captivated by; but I'm told it changes. All this place really needs a little reno, and it would be near perfect, or at least get 5 stars in my review.\n\nDespite the poor decor choice, they still roast some brilliant coffee. Even if you're not in the neighbourhood, it's worth the trip.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":2}

Tabülé is unquestionably one of these restaurants. Serving amazing Middle Eastern cuisine, Tabülé is a midtown spot not to be missed.\n\nTabülé offers fresh, intensely flavoured dishes from start to finish. Over several visits, I have had the pleasure of trying about half the menu and have yet to come across a dish that wasn't utterly delectable. Normally not a big fan of eggplant, I make exceptions here for the babaganüj, a gorgeous pureéd eggplant dip mixed with tahini, garlic and lemon juice. Additionally, the fried eggplant has great char on it and is finished with a lemon & garlic dressing that adds a bright note to the soft, creamy, rich starter. Not to be overlooked are the fresh, pungent tabülé and the labni which is a yogurt cheese mixed with a healthy dose of garlic and topped with zaatar. Finally, the hot cauliflower appetizer was recommended by the host who did not steer us in the wrong direction. Finished with Lebanese tahini, there were polite fights over who would get the last morsel.\n\nOnce you have gorged yourself on the hot and cold mezze (starters), it is time to move on the main event. There is always a fresh fish of the day, topped with the bright house lemon and garlic dressing. The grilled mains all come with heaping portions of rice with crispy onions for texture as well as grilled peppers, onions and zucchini. The kefta is certainly a popular option and a tasty one at that. Consider them Lebanese meatballs, made with a mix of ground lamb and beef, tomatoes, onions, parsley, garlic and lemon juice. Always perfectly cooked, they are steaming hot upon arrival at the table, a little bit pink inside. Also fabulous is the charcoal-broiled shrimp that have been marinated in Middle Eastern spices. Spicy and succulent, they are even slightly better with the squeeze of lemon that accompanies this particular dish. You will not want to share them with your dining companions.\n\nWhile you are thoroughly enjoying your food, take some time to look around and drink in the atmosphere. The restaurant itself is cozy without feeling claustrophobic and the dining room is host to just about every demographic in Toronto. You will see couples on dates, families, birthday celebrations, even bachelorette parties. On Saturday night, people wait patiently at the bar for a table and are entertained by the belly dancing show at 9pm. Though a little calmer during lunch, Tabülé certainly does not lack atmosphere. Upon return visits, you will notice that you see the same wait staff over and over again - a good sign in a turbulent industry. Hospitality is the name of the game here, and it is done expertly.\n\nShould you have room for dessert (and if you don't, just loosen your belt a little. It's worth it), check out the künafa ashta. Lebanese custard is topped with super fine shreds of phyllo pastry, pistachios and rose water syrup. Light and not overly sweet, this dish is a superb way to end a meal and is a paradigm of why Tabülé's menu is so successful: it combines many elements in a balanced, seamless dish. It is at once creamy, crunchy, a bit tart, a bit sweet and is highly aromatic.\n\nLike the final course of the evening, all the dishes at Tabülé balance flavor and texture and, because of this, the food is elevated beyond the ingredients. Pop in for a meal, or have one delivered to you: either way, you enjoy a hearty, mouth-watering meal that will have you coming back for more.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

In fact, most people may feel like its still neglected, but looking around, it's evident that there are signs of improvement. That's where Three Speed comes in. Located unseemingly near Pauline on Bloor street West, they definitely took a risk opening up in this somewhat seedy Toronto neighbourhood. But regardless the risk, it seems to have worked for them. Packed nightly with 20-something hipsters, it's difficult to get a seat if you show up past 8 or 9 o'clock, but don't let any of that stop you. As far as 'Blansdowne' goes, bar-wise there just isn't much that competes with it. \n\nThree Speed is brought about by the same people that started the Communist's Daughter, and they also have some affiliation with The Dakota, so you can expect the same sorta crowd and atmosphere--and dare I say pretentiousness--that you'd expect to see in any of those spots. If you can find the dam place that is...\n\nThree Speed is difficult to notice. In fact, if you weren't directly looking for it or didn't know where it was, you'd probably go right past; and if it wasn't for the red lights strung about the front window spiking my curiousity, I probably wouldn't have ever discovered it either. So when you're walking around Bloor and Lansdowne, and you finally do find it and get inside, the hidden-factor sorta gives the feel of a Bloordale oasis.\n\nThe inside of Three Speed is not what you'd expect by the near-crumbling exterior. Inside it's dimly lit, low-key, and seriously comfortable. With exposed brick, wood panels, and art galore, it's an easy place to want to hang out at.\n\nScribbled on a chalkboard and suspended on the bar wall, Three Speed has a slightly random food menu that displays their feature items, like mussels served in 1 of 3 styles,  Lo, Med, and High, indicating 'speed' but not content. You can expect well-rounded flavours of lime, fennel, and roasted garlic. No mistake, these are mighty good mussels.  But if there's a bunch of you, and mollusks aren't your thing, I'd recommend the Party Plate. It's a nice spread of cheese, meat, and pickled goodness. If you're not the sharing type, I'd go with the sirloin burger. Although I've definitely had better, this is still a savoury and sizeable burger that won't disappoint you.\n\nLike I said, it feels like the neighbourhood is on the mend and slowly losing its feel of neglect. There are even a few other cool spots that followed suit and opened up in this neighbourhood, like Holy Oak and the Starving Artist; both businesses that are beginning to do well.\n\nIf you're in the Bloordale area, hanging out at Three Speed is an easy, but slowly becoming not the only option. But the fact remains, these people have taken a crappy, ex-Karaoke dump in a less-than-desirable neighbourhood and turned it into something special that is directly impacting the culture of Bloordale and for that, they definitely deserve to be commended.

We know what we are doing!'\n\nWe took the advice, and waited for a table in a very cramped entrance way. With three other patrons in front of us, the hostess desk seemed very busy, but soon we were greeted and seated having had a table reserved at the suggestion of the hostess at Terroni.\n\nThe first thing we noticed, sitting at the end of a very long shared table, was how loud the music was. A mixture of 60s R&B and 70s Disco; it was far too loud. We actually couldn't even hear each other. Being a trio, I had to use my friend to the left to convey what I was saying to the friend sitting opposite me. At one point, while trying to explain my thoughts on my salad to the person across from me, they smiled, nodded, and asked 'so what salad are you having'? I'll admit the restaurant was packed, bustling, and full of all the noises that come with that, but despite that, the music was the biggest contributor to the noise.\n\nOur server soon appeared and did a great job answering all the questions we threw at him about red and white wines. He spoke well and seemed to truly care about recommending something we'd enjoy. Unfortunately, upon his return he gave the white to the red drinker and vice versa. To his credit, he noticed his own mistake and did not make it again with any of the refills.\n\nLooking at the menu, anyone familiar with Terroni will find a lot to like here. It is, as their website describes, a sort 'best of' all the food at Terroni, with something for everyone.\n\nBread arrived with olive oil to dip. The oil had a nice earthy bitterness and was quite enjoyable. Our salads arrived soon after: a Giuggiolosa with mixed greens with Cambozola cheese, grilled peppers, pine nuts, black olives, honey and a Barbabietole e Caprino with roasted beets, goat's cheese, lamb's lettuce, pistachios, candied lemon zest, and anchovy balsamic dressing. The Giuggiolosa was slightly too sweet and could have used a few more of Bettola's exceptional olives to add some more saltiness, but the Barbabietole e Caprino was near flawless. The beets were well roasted, and the flavours all stood out, as they should have. \n\nLooking at the menu, one of my guests fondly remembered having eaten Arancini di Modica on a ferry ride once from Italy to Sicily, so out of nostalgia, we ordered them. Arancini are breaded and deep-fried balls of rice, cheese and other fillings. At La Bettola di Terroni, they're filled with mozzarella and a pork ragout. They were a step above their peasant food origins, but all of us agreed that they weren't spectacular, didn't live up to the nostalgia, and we wouldn't be compelled to order them again.\n\nOur pizzas arrived soon after. Having been to other Terronis before, I knew what to expect, and so we decided to split two pizzas between the three of us. Although thin crusted, they're not small.\n\nWe ordered a Smendozzata, with sausage, red onion and gorgonzola on a tomato base, and a C't Mang with prosciutto, pear, walnuts and honey with gorgonzola and mozzarella on an olive oil base. The Smendozzata was classic Terroni style, and just as expected. The Gorgonzola was sharp and salty, and the sausage had a hint of fennel. Tasty. The C't Mang was also excellent, with the perfect combination of salty and sweet, and a nice sharpness from the Gorgonzola.\n\nOverall, it was a good meal. With La Bettola di Terroni, the Terroni family has added another feather in its cap. La Bettola di Terroni serves classic, Italian comfort food and serves it well. Besides the noise level, it's be a great place to take a date, bring the family, or bring friends.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1}

It had multiple locations around Toronto, and it was focused heavily on the food and culture of its Ukrainian ownership. While the Annex location is still kicking strong and remains a popular beacon for starving U of T students, the others, except for the tiny St. Lawrence Market outlet and a baking factory in the city's Westend, have all but disappeared. All that remains is a lone, ceramic Ukrainian Easter egg sitting high up on a shelf in the Annex location. But time moves on I suppose, and there's a reason that despite the others all going under, the Annex location is still packed at almost all hours of the day.\n\nFuture is cheap. Straight up, that's probably one of the predominant reasons they're so busy, but it's not as if you're getting some reheated crappy food for your money. They make some pretty good stuff. (Right off the bat, I'd like to point out that there is a food outlet right in the back of this place, and I think they sublease it to sell food in there, but I am including it in this review, despite that they might be two different places.) Most notably, you can grab a pretty good breakfast there, especially on a Sunday morning. Sundays in the Annex are deadsville; everything is closed until the early-afternoon, so if you live in the area or you happen to find yourself there because you thought everything would be open, this is a great place to grab a pleasant morning breakfast or a greasy hangover cure.\n\nFuture has some seriously amazing cakes, and if that's your thing, then you should know that Future is probably one of the best values for cake in the city. Besides having a killer selection of top quality cakes, they all sell for about 5 bucks a cut. There are a whole ton of different kinds too, ranging from fruit pies and caramel-based cakes to cheesecakes and heavy-chocolate tortes. Although I don't find their coffee particularly spectacular, they do have it available, and it's still a pretty natural choice to go with the cake, despite being nothing-more-than-average.\n\nOnce the warmer months hit, Future place has got a pretty spectacular patio too.  Busy, big, and perfect for people watching, it's easily the 2nd best patio spot in the Annex. It covers the whole side of Future's corner building, and it's an ideal place for cold pints.\n\nFuture pretty much accommodates everyone. Early morning breakfast, late night after the bar, mid-week meeting spot, in-between-classes study hole; no matter what you're using it for, chances are that Future will be able to offer you something. So despite the fact that the Ukrainian aspect is no longer really existing here--or at least not being a visible existence--it hasn't slowed this place down at all. Most likely, people haven't even noticed the lack of Ukrainianess. And while purely for nostalgic reasons, I find that a bit on the disappointing side, as long as every time I go in there I can be reminded of Future's past by that lone Uki Easter egg, I'll make due, and I'll being eating cake.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1}

I hesitate to say I \"stumbled\" upon this particular location as it is quite visible across from the main strip of theatres on this part of King Street, but I did enter on quite the spontaneous whim.\n\nTheir contemporary and inviting atmosphere is infused with Motown and Blues décor and music, which sets the mood perfectly for their southern dishes.  They offer up a nicely balanced menu of traditional Cajun-style grub and the more typical Canadian restaurant fare; from fish and fried foods galore, to goat-cheese-adorned salads and honey-garlic chicken, there really is something for everyone.\n\nI popped in early and was greeted with the notice of half-priced appetizers before 8:00 p.m. - a great opportunity to try a couple.  There are plenty of barbecued chicken, rib and steak platters to choose from, but what could be more appropriate than their cornmeal crusted catfish sticks?  I had them with the goat cheese and Cajun-roasted pistachio salad, and it turned out to be a delightful meal.\n\nThe catfish sticks are a must. After I ordered, a small plate with one tiny morsel of something arrived in front of me - this was worrisome.  Thankfully, it was just a mini-muffin sized, mildly sweet portion of cornbread (a side note: not enough restaurants give you complimentary bread at the table anymore; it does not have to be an overflowing basket of buns, but just a small bite of something light and delicious starts the meal off right). When the fish did arrive, I was more than impressed with the serving size. They were light and crispy and with smokey-sweet Cajun spice and served a tangy tartar sauce.\n\nThe salad had a hint of that same Cajun spice on the pistachios, but was otherwise just as expected for greens, except for one crucial detail - the copious amount of cheese!  Finally, a restaurant after my own dairy-loving heart!  I have too often overpaid for goat-cheese-promising pastas and salads that have fallen short.  Joe Mamas, on the other hand, gave me a meal-size salad, with more than my fair share of cheese, and all at half-price no less!\n\nI eased myself into my first southern cuisine experience with a dinner of appetizers, worried that I might be confronted with an over-spiced and over-fried spread.  Thankfully proven wrong, on my next visit to Joe Mamas, I'll be diving into their menu with less hesitancy.","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":4}

Casual viewers need not apply. A bar boasting North America's biggest HD TV screen, and at 39 feet, they are not exaggerating, creates a certain atmosphere, but that may not be what everyone is looking for in a sports bar...let me explain. \n\nReal Sports is shiny, flashy and new. The place is decked out with 199 other HD TV screens, all vying for your attention, on top of the main attraction. The bar is lit up with translucent coloured panels, creating a space that feels a bit more like a nightclub than a bar and grill. The wait staff all look really good, but it seems to take the entire quarter of a basketball game to get your drink or order a meal.\n\nReal Sports menu is comprehensive and well thought out. They serve 12 different flavours of chicken wings, and a great selection of sandwiches and burgers. I can attest to the quality of both the Grilled Chicken on Swiss Panini and the Grilled Portobello Mushroom Sandwich ($13, $12). Real Sports also serves of a variety of appetizers, hot dogs, poutine, salads and some filling entrees of ribs, salmon and meatloaf. But here is where the fun stops. I have not had good luck with the appetizers at Real Sports, often finding the portion to be smaller than I expected, and the food lacking a certain something. The calamari was a bit dry, and the chipotle mayo has been done. When I ordered the sweet potato fries as an appetizer, the portion of \"5 spice aioli\" that came on the side could have been consumed within the first two fries. I was not impressed. \n\nFood issues aside, Real Sports serves up 112 different beers on tap, and a decent selection of wine and whiskey. Expect to pay a steep price, however. With most of the beer prices ranging between $6.25 and $8.50, and wine from $9 up to $23.50 a glass, the \"sports\" theme of the bar is quickly replaced with the pricing of a mid-range restaurant. I must admit, I have never been able to digest the alcohol prices at Real Sports.\n\nWhat Real Sports lacks in food and prices, however, it makes up for in location and style. Located walking distance to the Rogers Centre, and across the street from the Air Canada Centre, it is, literally, a 30 second walk to the ACC, giving meaning to the \"real\" in Real Sports. With more TV's than you could find inside the biggest BestBuy store out there, you will never miss a game or event again. It really feels like Real Sports is actually playing every sporting event in the world, and you can take your pick. \n\nReal Sports boasts a 90-foot ice bar, which swaggering up to and ordering a drink at feels pretty cool (pun intended). It's a neat gimmick, but also extremely functional, as those sitting at the bar always have a cold drink. I have just never quite figured out where to rest my hands. \nReal Sports is loaded with seating, it always seem that there is a place to sit. With the bar spanning over two levels, all with forward facing booths, there really isn't a bad seat in the house.\n\nIf you are looking for a good time, and not extremely concerned with the quality, or price, of your food and beverage, then by all means, head over to Real Sports; I can almost guarantee you will have a good time. Seeing the 39-foot TV for the first time is a fun experience, especially when your team is playing on it. If you go to Real Sports with realistic expectations, you will not be disappointed.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

You take stock of your options and think, \"These places all look kind of similar - where should I head?\" Might I suggest you check out Joe Badali's, an Italian-themed restaurant on Front St. West, steps from both the Rogers Centre and the ACC. The spacious bar\/restaurant has something for everyone, a key to success for large groups that often book parties there.\n\nA friend and I popped in the other day to check out their fall\/winter brunch menu. Given our choice of bar, table or booth, we opted for a cozy booth in the middle of the restaurant and were given three menus from which to choose our meal. A bit overwhelming, perhaps, but our waiter explained that one menu was strictly for their new pescetarian promotion where you can choose the fish you'd like and how you'd like it cooked. Feeling like it was a little early for ahi tuna, my companion and I went for the brunch options: I had the eggs benedictano and he had the steak frites, ordered medium rare. To accompany our selections, we ordered the pear and cranberry cider and the maple bourbon lemonade. (Both drinks made by the fabulous bartender, Katie, who also makes mean After Eights and Monte Cristos.)  \n\nA plate of house- made bread was brought to the table, accompanied by olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Warm, crusty and soft on the inside, we polished off that complimentary snack pretty quickly while we sipped our delicious drinks. The wait staff is clearly comfortable with time crunches of customers and took into consideration that the tables around us had a short amount of time to eat before they needed to head elsewhere. The service was swift and friendly for them, while it was a little more relaxed for us  - though by no means slow or lackadaisical.\nWhen our brunch plates arrived, we were eager to dive in. Neither my companion nor I had been to Joe Badali's in quite some time and wondered how brunch would stack up. The portions were a good size and, importantly, cooked as they should be. My egg yolks were runny and the Canadian back bacon was a great salty accompaniment. The ciabatta base was a nice touch, as it worked well to absorb the leftover yolk on my plate. The home fries might have been a bit crispier, but the peppers and onions were crunchy contrast to the creaminess of the eggs. As for the steak frites, the steak was indeed medium rare and had been rested properly before being brought to the table. By the end of the meal, only a few pieces of diced fruit were left in our respective cups.\n\nSince we felt like indulging at this particular brunch, we allowed ourselves to split a very generous portion of white chocolate mousse cake with strawberry topping. Not overly heavy, it was actually quite a nice way to wrap up a meal. As mentioned earlier, we also tried the After Eight and Monte Cristo specialty coffees. Topped with whipped cream and a cherry, these were decadent and deliciously boozy. We allowed ourselves a few minutes - and a couple of glasses of water - before attempting to get up.\nWhen asked about the capacity of the place, we learned that Badali's can hold up to 750 people, making it a great place for large parties. We also discovered that they set up a secluded patio in the summers, blocking off the adjacent parking lot in order to make it a pleasant place to escape the downtown crush. If you happen to be in the area - say, before a concert, a Leafs, Raptors or Jays game - check out Joe Badali's. You're bound to find something for everyone at reasonable prices. And if you're in the mood for a drink, I highly recommend checking out either the maple bourbon lemonade or pear and cranberry cider. Had it been later in the day when we went, I suspect there may have been a few more rounds of these!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

This whole area is pretty packed with coffee shops and the like. Just up the road in The Junction, there's Crema, The Good Neighbour, and a Starbucks; just down the road in Roncys, there's Alternative Grounds, Coffee and All that Jazz, and yet another Starbucks. And that's just to name a few... The neighbourhood, it seems, is littered with coffee shops. So how does Hula Girl stack up against all the rest of them? Really, really nicely.\n\nHula Girl isn't just another boring-old coffee shop; they're an 'espresso boutique', and they focus their boutique-ish expertise on blends of Kona coffee beans and turning those blends of beans into near-perfect cups of espresso. The owners are clearly not only passionate about coffee, but knowledgeable about it too; it becomes blatantly obvious with the first sip. The espresso is noticeably balanced and brewed with a high-level of skill. Simply put, they have some truly nice people that are dam good at pulling espressos standing behind their shiny brewing machine.\n\nNo worries if espresso isn't your thing. They have some of their Kona blends brewed and served as the standard coffee fare too, which is also seriously good. They've got a nice window at the front counter with some baked goods. There isn't much there right now, as I think they've only recently started serving food, but it sure would look good stocked with some interesting, local pastries and deserts.\n\nThe space is beautiful too. Chances are, after you pick up an espresso you're going to want to stay for a bit and soak up some of the killer atmosphere. Old wood, exposed brick, shiny chrome, the entire space is exquisitely designed and faultlessly put together. Fair warning though, the insides may be pretty to look at, but they sure aren't big. It's ok though. What Hula Girl lacks in space, it makes up in comfort. Sitting around Hula Girl and sipping an espresso just feels good. The space is nice, and there's a few wooden chairs and a little bar space where relaxing music, a comfortable vibe, and fantastic coffee is all in abundance.\n\nChances are, they'll be busy too. People around here seem to have already shifted their morning-coffee-loyalties over to Hula Girl, and that's a good thing, for Hula Girl and you. Somehow, in this small environment, more people just make it feel cozier, which you'll appreciate. And obviously it's good for Hula Girl because they get to succeed and stick-around, and honestly, there isn't much that's nicer to see succeed than an independent business run by nice people.\n\nGood on the folks at Hula Girl for opening up on this tired part of Dundas with its old pizza joints and 2 dollar palm reading shops. This street really needed a place like this, and no doubt the people that live there will appreciate it too. Especially among all the artsy stuff that's crept up around here, pizza and palm-readings aside, Hula Girl seems perfectly at home.\n\nLike I said, the coffee is spectacular. So if you want some near-perfect espresso made by people that truly know what that means, then Hula Girl should be on your to-do-list; but if you're looking for a place to grab a donut and suck up some free-WiFi, keep walking up the street to The Junction or down the street to Roncys.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Where By the Way loses some points is with the service. It seemed to take forever between times the server came to our table.

I too was skeptical but went along for the ride anyways when a friend suggested we go. While perusing the online menu, I was genuinely stumped as to what I would get. I already eat at least one - but generally several - vegetarian meals a week, so I'm not opposed to eating a meal with no meat. But Live is a vegan, organic restaurant that features recipes without gluten, without sugar and certainly without any animal products which is outside my culinary experience. If you happen to feel the same way, I suggest you go with an open mind as Live has an excellent reputation and it is well earned. \n\nI settled in to the table at the front, which has a great view of the world walking by, of the bright, cheerful restaurant. While I waited for my dining companions, I had a look through the drink list and eventually settled on a bottle Mill Street Organic. (Should I come back in the summer, I will definitely sample the cocktails on the lovely patio!) When the ladies arrived, we ordered a bottle of organic cabernet sauvignon and started going over the menu for the millionth time. It is an extensive list with dishes that should appeal to just about all diners. Appetizers, salads, bowls, mains, pasta, dessert: Live certainly does not lack for choice. The three of us agreed that we wanted to try the chick pea fries, so we ordered those while attempting to make a decision.\n\nFinally, we made our choices: raw sushi with pumpkin & sunflower seed nori rolls and a detox salad; \"Bacon Cheese\" burger; and tempeh cakes with a warm corn, avocado and white wine salsa. Orders placed, we tucked into our wine and the chick pea fries which arrived shortly thereafter. Crispy on the outside, piping hot and soft on the inside, this non-traditional take on a staple hit the spot, especially with the homemade BBQ sauce on the side.\n\nOur mains arrived in a timely manner, and we hungrily tucked in to them. The sushi roll had a great combination of flavour and texture. I was a little jealous of not ordering that one for myself, but my giant plate of food was more than enough. The tempeh (an Indonesian soybean product) cakes were piled high on top of the wonderful salsa that was accompanied by a spicy chipotle aioli. If you're hungry, get this dish. It was undoubtedly for the best that I did not order an appetizer, as well as the cakes and sides were so surprisingly good that I was nearly scraping my plate. \n\nAs for the \"cheese bacon\" burger, it passed the taste test. The patty consisted of chick peas and had macadamia cheddar \"cheese\" and eggplant \"bacon.\" I can see your eyebrows raising. The eggplant had a smoky flavour and was quite good, though certainly not bacon. The cheese in question was a bit of a head-scratcher, though not unpleasant. The gluten-free bun was nicely toasted and the BBQ sauce was a great touch.\n\nSince we had already gone through much of the menu, we thought we should give dessert a whirl. All the desserts are kept on display in near the back of the restaurant, and there is quite an array from which to choose. We opted for two: the tiramisu and the Black Forrest cake. Now, my Italian friends would be horrified to find a tiramisu without real cream, but it really was quite good with a strong, but not overpowering, taste of espresso. Similarly, the Black Forrest cake was rich, creamy and cut nicely with the cherries on top. No complaints - I certainly didn't feel like I was missing out.\n\nLive has a great vibe to it and customers were constantly arriving either to have a seated meal or to pick up their take-out orders. The music is at just the right volume and the staff is friendly and accommodating. We were there for several hours and never felt rushed, nor got the idea that we were no longer welcome. Food arrives promptly and with a smile, water bottles are refilled, and the service is relaxed. So take your vegetarian friends, take your carnivorous friends: they will likely all be satisfied. The portions are well-sized and, most importantly, the food is delicious.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

It's located in The Junction at 2883 Dundas St. West (at Keele).\n\nPlaya Cabana Cantina is the second location for Playa Cabana - with it's first location on Dupont (at Davenport). The Junction has accepted it well, considering there were absolutely no reservations available for the whole weekend - but they assured me that they keep the bar open for walk ins.\n\nSo we walked in. Right away I was impressed by the decor, there's plenty of neon-lit signs including a shout out to JUNCTION - WEST TORONTO, and an \"Keep and Enforce Prohibition\" sign at the bar - perhaps a little tongue in cheek reference to The Junction's past as a dry neighbourhood until 2000.\n\nThe menu here is set up a little differently than other taco favourites like Grand Electric or La Carnita. Instead of ordering tapas style - one taco at a time, Playa Cantina's menu includes everything from tacos and tostados to burritos and enchiladas along with a side of rice and black or pinto beans.\n\nWe started off the meal with guacamole and chips. The chips arrived warm to the table and were extra crispy and fresh. The guacamole was smooth and not too spicy for our tastes. The bartender replenished the chips free of charge too, which is a great touch.\n\nPlaya Cabana Cantina has a fresh oyster bar set up, and at $2 a shuck, we couldn't resist them. They were huge, no skimping here, and were served with horseradish and hot sauce. Then, we each ordered a set of tacos with a side of rice and black beans, after starting off with Amber Agave Margaritas.\n\nThe Ancho Braised Shortrib-Brisket Crispy Tacos were served on a corn tortilla with melted cheese, sour cream and pico de gallo. They came to the table piping hot, and the mix of brisket and cheese was perfect along with the extra crispy tortilla. They were reasonably priced at $14 for an entree.\n\nNext up was the Tacos de Pescado (Baja-Style fish tacos) for $13 . They were a little underwhelming in comparison. The breaded tilapia didn't have the substance to stand up to the guacamole and shredded cabbage filling. Usually I'm a big fan of a good fish taco but this wasn't the best I've had lately.\n\nPersonally, I prefer picking and choosing different tacos to try instead of ordering them as a personal entree. The sides of yellow rice and beans were fresh and a great addition, but it would have been great to try a few different kinds of tacos instead of three of one kind.\n\nWith another round of drinks coming, we felt the need for some dessert... Unsure of what to get, the bartender recommended the Mexican Flan, so we gave it a shot. After waiting a little longer than necessary (I think the kitchen forgot about us), our bartender arrived with the flan, which was actually 2 mini flan served with whipped cream. He apologized for the delay and said the dessert was on the house.\nOverall the personal service at the bar was great, the bartender gave us a lot of recommendations on what to order and was more than helpful. The atmosphere was comfortable and casual, it didn't have that 'too cool' vibe that many new restaurants are picking up on now.\n\nWe definitely will be returning to try out the burritos and other menu items along with the amazing guacamole again too. The tacos were flavourful, with fresh, house made ingredients but not the best of what the city has to offer right now.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":3}

I felt as if he was most honest, very confident and I never once felt rushed, he answered all my questions and concerns.

We tried the Hen of the Woods mushrooms, gold yukon potato puree and asparagus. The hen of the woods mushrooms were quite good, but nothing I can't put together myself. They had no great sauce, no POW factor. The gold yukon potatoes were fine - nice potatoes that were boiled and pureed to baby-food texture. No special or unique flavors going on there. Finally, I'm convinced the asparagus was just microwaved in some water. Very poor effort there, guys. Considering each of these dishes was $15-$25, I'm very disappointed. \n\nNow, onto some better things. I had the lobster bisque which was very good. Nice and creamy with succulent chunks of lobster. The only complaint I have, if it even counts, is that they served me a ton. It was very rich and I didn't have a cup of bisque, it was a giant bowl. \n\nOn to the most important thing, which were the steaks. My friends ordered the 16oz Ribeye, 16oz New York Strip, 12oz Hanger and I had the grade 8 12oz wagyu beef skirt steak. They were all really, really good but I have mixed feelings here. Sure, they were cooked perfectly, but I can do that at home on my grill. No sauces here, nothing; just pure steak goodness. It was my first time ordering the wagyu beef, and it was good, but I actually preferred the Hanger of the four steaks we ordered. \n\nOverview: The service was impeccable. The wine list was extensive (however out of our price range, at $125 per person without drinks). Though the steaks and bisque were great, the sides were eerily reminiscent of my grandmothers (terrible) cooking. I think Craftsteak is a poor value for your buck, therefore I'll give it 3\/5 - A-OK.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0}

They were a bit too long, but they lasted well over two months and were surprisingly were very low maintenance. The woman who did it just said not to be rough with them, to not use mascara, and to use oil free remover.\n\nI wanted eyelash extensions again for a trip I was taking on a Friday. The Sunday before my trip, I went to this location for a petite set. I was given a packet of materials, and part of it said to get your lashes done at least a few days before an event. Lucky me, I thought, because I was going about 4 days before leaving. I figured my lashes would last for at least a few weeks and then I'd have to get a touch up to just fill in empty spots. Boy, was I wrong.\n\nFirst of all, the woman who worked on my eyes must not have washed her hands. I could smell a strong peanut butter smell, and those little latex finger things they use didn't help. \n\nSecond, my lashes lasted for less than a week and a half, despite me following their instructions to the letter. I didn't wear any eye makeup for several days before, I didn't wash my eyes the day I got them and for a couple of days after, and I barely wore any eye makeup at all and definitely did not use mascara. When I did wear eye makeup, I used makeup remover that was oil free and meant for lash extensions. I was on vacation but didn't swim or submerge my head. When I took a shower, I kept my face out of the water at all times. Even with me being extremely careful, every time I blinked another lash would fall off. By the end of the week they were 90% gone.\n\nI was extremely disappointed with the lashes. I am also pretty suspicious of the fact that they push you to get an annual membership so you can get a refill once month. \n\nAnyway, I'm glad I got a Groupon for this because I would have been even more mad if I had paid full price ($250). Never coming here again.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Well, that is completely inaccurate. It's apparent that this manager is stating FALSE information. If you recall correctly, I had my husband's vehicle with his set of keys and he had my vehicle with my set of keys (which OBVIOUSLY would have MY key fob on my key chain). Therefore, tell me how this is NOT putting my key fob in a \"convenient place?\" Really? Are you that stupid? Having my key fob on my key chain is NOT a convenient place? This manager clearly doesn't know what he's talking about. As I said previously, I wasn't trying to scam the gym by getting 2 keys fobs. I am not a deceitful person. All I asked is for this facility to provide me with a way to get into their gym, \"that I fund,\" if I didn't have my set of keys. They talk about providing security, but i guess they prefer that you to wait until a customer leaves the gym, grabbing the door behind them, before it closes, in order to get jn. This is what I had to do on several occasions, as I didnt have my set of keys with my key fob. And each time this happened, there was NO staff member present around 7pm to even IDENTIFY me. Do you call this security? I could have been a \"non-member\" walking into the gym for free. What a joke!!! This leads me into my next question...what is one to do when they forget their key fob and no staff memeber is present, to let you into the gym after 5:30pm? Are you supposed to go home and abandon your workout for the day? I know I am NOT the ONLY person out there that this has happened to. \nAs an owner of my own company, I believe in conflict resolution, honesty and customer service. So let me be the mature, managerial, adult here and say humbly, that my comment on the early termination fee was incorrect. The $341 fee was my contractual commitment. I realize this was my contractual responsibility, which is why I paid it. So I stand corrected on this. Why doesnt this gym offer an APOLOGY to me, rather than be argumentative and flippant???\nBottom line, these people are not real business men, because they should know that you don't argue with a \"paying customer.\" Obviously their egos are more important than their customers. But what can you expect from a mediocre, gym manager? You're NOT that important.","useful":8,"funny":5,"cool":0}

They delivered everything to the venue on time, which made the day much less stressful for me. Additionally, their customer service was exceptional, they were just wonderful, easy to work with and very accommodating.\n\nI've been disappointed with florists in the past because you typically get something smaller and more disappointing than what is advertised in photos. VIP Floral Designs delivered the opposite--something bigger and better than what I expected! I couldn't be happier with my experience with them. I highly recommend this florist.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

While they were doing that the mechanic came out and told me my struts were leaking oil and needed to be replaced, said he could do it for $900. I thought this was weird because I had just taken my car in to the dealer to get an oil change and if they could have sold me new struts I'm sure they would have. When I said I'd think about it he tried to get me to sign up for their credit card, said \"he was just trying to help me out.\"\n\nThe next weekend I took my car to a mechanic I trust and he told me the struts were in good shape and not leaking anything - so NTB was either trying to rip me off or are incompetent.\n\nTo further lower my opinion of this shop, a few days after the rotation my car said all the tire pressures were low - they didn't even do that right.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

As an example, recently I went with a friend who explained to the server that she was gluten intolerant and order the GF pasta. Despite that, her pasta came with two slices of bread on top. To me, that seems like something that should have been considered, and if it was an honest mistake, that would have been ok. However, the server acted as though it was preposterous that she asked for another plate. She was extremely disrespectful despite the fact that my party was respectful towards her. I really want to like and enjoy this spot and I think the food is great, but the experience of eating out is 100 percent framed by your service and on a couple of occasions it's been subpar to horrible at Al Mike's.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I've been in a couple of times with my boyfriend and so far we've tried the shrimp po-boy, catfish reuben, lobster roll, and $1 Sea level oysters. Everything was delicious, but the catfish reuben was the real stand out dish. The sandwiches all come with french fries, which are really tasty. The lobster roll could use a little more butter drizzled on top, but that's my only critique of the food so far. \n\nWhat I really love about Sea Level is that it seems to strike a great balance of semi-fine dining, while also being casual, if that's what your mood is. To that end, there's a big patio, and a good bit of bar seating, so even on a busy weekend evening, you may be able to be seated without a reservation at one of the aforementioned locations. Additionally, the service is fabulous. The servers are very professional - They know their stuff and they ensure patrons have a great dining experience. Finally, I love that there are cheaper options (i.e. $2 beer, $5 house wines, ~$12 sandwiches, and $1 oysters), and there are plenty of high quality, more expensive options as well.

Discovered it about 3 weeks ago and I've been here 6 times.  My husband and I have tried the philly, gyro and burger. For me... I can't stay away from that Philly... the perfect ratio of mushroom, onion cheese and juicy meat.  It all blends together to a perfect, almost creamy bite every time.  Everything is made to order so it's really hot and fresh.  I love the steak fries that are always well seasoned.  The restaurant itself is very clean and the staff are very nice and polite.\n\nI keep telling myself I'm going to try the gyro salad but I'll save that for after the new year when I get on the scale after the holidays.

Side note: our first excellent experience included the tasting menu. He ordered the four course, while I ordered a salad and entree.  His four courses were full of delicious food that was enough to feed us both.  Neither of us were able to finish our meals, and we left full and happy!  But tonight, our tasting menu options and delivery were beyond disappointing.\n\nWe decided to sit at the bar tonight.  When we sat down we were eyed down by the female bartender who reluctantly took our order.  She didn't bother to tell us the specials, which we later overheard her share with other customers, and she didn't ask if we were interested in any food.  Before we were finished with our drinks, she brought over our check; were we being rushed out of this NOT crowded bar?  I had a bad feeling, and I wish I would have trusted my gut to leave.  We asked her for another round and let her know we were going to order dinner and had a groupon.\n\nOur service was bad before we told her we had a groupon, and it only spiraled down from there.  But bad service I can handle, it was the food that made me jump onto yelp!  The tasting menu was for family style service so we had to pick the same four items for dinner.  Family style?  This is different than last time, I thought.... Our first course was a variety of meats, cheeses, and olives.  It was a much smaller portion than he had during our first visit to elements, but who needs to over eat meat and cheese anyway?  The second course was a beat and goat cheese salad.  The salad was large and more than enough for two people (aka filler).  When our entree arrived I almost fell off of my barstool.  There was one filet of salmon for the two of us to share.  It wasn't a monstrous sized salmon as big as my head, it wasn't two of my fists, it was a small piece of salmon meant to feed both of us.  I am mortified that I didn't call attention to this at the restaurant, but I couldn't believe that I had been served a 'family style' portion of salmon that included only one piece of fish.  WHAT?  Dessert wasn't memorable, but what I do remember is not being asked if I wanted coffee to accompany it either.\n\nI'm not even mentioning in detail the bartender's awkward comments that we cleaned our plates during our meal or that another bartender knocked over my glass of wine. Please, don't go to elements.  There are too many better restaurants in Pittsburgh to waste anymore thought on this dump.\n\n\nNote to restaurants: If you don't like people who use groupons, then please don't invite us into your restaurant only to treat us poorly. Like I said earlier, this was our third visit to Elements.  We bought the groupon because we were repeat customers, we liked the restaurant, and now we will never go back.\n\n**UPDATE**\nI followed up with Groupon and Elements.  Groupon refunded our money with no problem at all.  When I called Elements, they said the owner wanted to speak to me after reading my review on yelp, but he wasn't available.  He called me back once, and I returned the call.  I haven't heard back anything.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

But it seems the bay is actually one of the top places to more likely find such coffee shops, where a cappuccino is actually a cappuccino.\n\nSo here's this awesome spot in Las Vegas I've personally found, the first so far in this city.  It was worth walking past a few Starbucks shops on the way here! It is literally written on their walls how they value making coffee right here (there's cool chalk drawings of the differences between different types of orders, TVs showing the farming process, etc). \n\nThe shop is really clean and rather spacious. It's a nice place to even study, have a conversation, or just meet, with outdoor seating as well if you really wanna. It's currently nicely air conditioned indoors, well furnished with tables, and for the jusr 3 times I've been around they've played a nice variety of music.\n\nAfter all I've said about crafting a cup of coffee well, I'll say it was amusing watching another customer complain outloud, asking what was going on today, and how her \"furtado isn't even hot enough\" ^_^ ... What is to note though is how they handled it. They were generous enough to make another one, and just maintained courteous service pretty much. Besides that they've just been the nicest people so far, nice to talk to.\n\nBonus support: Bruxie is pretty close by, if you want a more filling waffle & chicken meal first. Mmm.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Not sure if it's all of Vegas but I had never noticed so much dust in my room at other hotels before.  \n-  Valet parking: kinda inconvenient when you need to get something from your car\n-  Sofabed is extremely flimsy, if you have more than 2 people, insist on 2 queen beds.  the sofa cushions are much more comfortable.\n\nOther points:\n*  Should call ahead of time to make sure your room have the # of beds you requested when you booked.  (We didn't get our 2 queen beds although we checked in at 2pm.  They were nice enough to switch us to a slightly bigger suite with washer\/dryer.)\n*  Hotel lobby is extremely small!\n*  In-room food service was overpriced (and food was only so-so).  Ask the front desk for a nearby delivery restaurant.  We ordered from there our 2nd night and got a ton of food for 1\/2 the price we paid room service!\n*  Don't go to the 7-11, it's shady.

The price was reasonable and being that we found this company at the home show and because the company was licensed and bonded we hired them to do the job.  We were told the job would take 4 days and we checked on the progress every day.  Again this is our brand new never lived in home, on the last day of painting we checked on the progress only to find the painting was completed along with major damage to our brand new shower.  The owner did not call us when the damage occured and when we contacted him he fessed up and apologized that one of his workers had fallen off a ladder and broke an entire slab of stone in our shower and promised to take care of the damage.  When we asked why we were not told when it happened the owner said he was trying to come up with a solution first.  Seemed odd to us we werent told immediately but let it go.  We then had to get the original stone installers to our new home for an estimate and provided the estimate to the painter.  The owner of the company did send us a check for the difference of what we owed him and the damage to our stone which is still not yet fixed as it had to be ordered so we have been without a shower now for over two weeks.\n\nWe thought this would all be behind us and that it was just an unfortunate accident that wasnt handled very well.  That was until we found further damage to the outside of our home.  It was obvious more damage was done by the companies workers!  They had dragged a pallet of paint from our gate to our back door in our backyard.  The pallet was left in our backyard and we were able to trace the lines the pallet made all the way to its last ending point.  Based on the tracks it appears the workers pushed the pallet around the corner of our house and pulled so hard it removed the stucco and paint from the side of our BRAND NEW house.  \n\nI was never advised of this damage either and when we emailed the owner of the company we never received a response.  We are beyond dissatisfied with this company based on the damage they did to our home not once, but twice and how it was handled.

The brussel sprouts - a $10 side - were cooked with bacon and ham and all you could taste was salt and smoke. The sweet potato - another $10 side - was blended with marshmallow on top. Yes - marshmallow.

I don't have the energy to  write a detailed review because for the last year and a half, my energy has gone into playing phone tag and  complaining about  the lack of service from my usual tech. The day I received my keys for my house a year and a half ago, I checked out the condition of the pool. The pool was clean but the vacuum was very slow. I called to let them know it's not working properly an was told that I need to turn it on.  That was their attitude towards the situation. My reason for calling that day was to avoid what actually ended up happening....which is a pump replacement. For the last year and a half I have been calling to say that, basically, the pool is constantly dirty and green because it's not working and have asked if someone can check it out. Usually, my request is ignored. If, somehow magical forces collided, and the tech actually does take a look, I have been told that the issue is an o-ring replacement or a diaphragm replacement.  I have paid for parts multiple times but I am not sure if the parts were actually replaced because the issues continued. Again, my concerns were ignored until just recently they told me I need a new pump. I am irritated because they are sayin I let the pool get too dirty and that's why the pump has gone out. I  have tried to complain about the tech letting the pool stay green during the winter months but nothing was done about it. Their response was that the tech never mentioned anything about it. Of course not! He would be snitching on himself for not doing anything about it. They tried to tell me that the pump went out because I never had the cleaning service done. I never did because why would I have them brush the steps and tile when I do that myself and I do not trust them enough to take care of the other comps ta of their cleaning service because they rob me already by not doin anything when they see the pool needs to be backwashed and when the pool is green. Plus, they never said the cleaning service is needed for the pool to function properly. They were only trying to up sell this service. \n\nAlso, this company will try to sell a service to lower yor calcium level. Don't fall for it. They will call and email you about it...DO NOT fall for it. Many pool companies try to sell this service but it's bullshit. My bottom of my pool contained a lot of dirt because the vacuum wasn't working and it was green for months but the tech never took the initiative to fix it but yet I'm getting calls AND emails about my calcium levels. Really? The tech will report that but NOT a green pool? I do t think so.\nPlus, while speaking with an overly defensive customer service representative today, this individual read through all of the notes and NOT ONCE did he mention the calcium levels were high. That's because it's all fake.\n\nThe only reason why I am a customer is because of the salt pump.","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":0}

The employees and owner all live up to the name and their mission. The owner came by to check out my situation the next day after I contacted Honest Pool Care. He was very eager to check it out, as he was concerned about the problem becoming worse if we waited too long. He was very thorough during his visit. He wasn't there for the full hour. Therefore, he had no interest in charging me for the full hour visit. He gladly reduced the price for me. Awesome! He could have very easily charged me full price as he was there for more than 30 minutes. He told me what he thinks might be the root of the issue but stressed he would talk it over with some repair techs to be sure and to avoid unnecessary costs and repairs. After discussing with his crew, he called me to inform me of their findings the following day. I love that this company is on top of things! Regretfully, I was a former Poolman customer. Dealing with that company is like pulling teeth. It takes a week just to talk about an issue with that awful company.  He was honest and told me what he had initially thought was the issue, no longer seems to be an issue at all. He explained to me what was going on and offered me options to fix this problem.  I appreciate that as well because he could have easily taken advantage and  only offer one solution...one where his company would profit. Experiencing this level of great customer service helps to ease my nervous attitude toward this situation. Also, I must note that I live in South Phoenix. I called multiple pool companies that claim they service Phoenix and surrounding areas. However, none of them were willing to come this far south. Honest Pool Care, according to this site, services Tempe and surrounding areas. This company is willing to come to this area.

Right at the front they tell me i have to leave my stroller behind...are you kidding me... no restaurant has ever ask me to do that before...what if one of my kids was sleeping? i actually  try to time it that way so i can eat a meal in peace.\n\nSince we were all hungry i figured ok lets just stay in.I asked for a booth because it is easier to manage my 3 yr old in there.The waitress gave me a weird look and said that a booth is not available and we can  sit at a regular tabe...why...i do not know...the restaurant wasn't even that busy\n\n.ok so i am getting pretty irritaded by now...i insisted of getting that booth...she gave it to us but with an attitude. I figured it can not get any worst than this lets just enjoy our meal.\n\nAs i am getting the menu i ask for the high chair...the waitress tells me she can not give me the high chair because we are sitting in a booth...what?!..i always get a high chair sitting in a booth and it is never a problem and maybe if you didn't take my stroller away i would be able to put my younger child in there.\n\nAt this point i asked for a  manager. She tells me how it is dangerous for my son to sit there because it is blocking the waitress to serve the food to our table  and the food is hot...and they are concerned about safety...believe me there was more than enough space \n\n\nI was quite upset at this point so she brings me a high chair...the one that you are supposed to strap in to a chair...hello...i can not strap this to anything we are sitting in a booth...am i supposed to sit my 1 yr old child in a high chair that is not straped in into anything...i think that it is pretty dangerous!\n\nDon't ask why but we stayed anyway with me and my child sitting on my lap.\n\nBUT I TOLD MYSELF I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN ...EVER!\n\nIt is a waste of a good restaurant...poor management!\n\nI would highly recommend the Promenade location.

What drew us in was the sign outside announcing their $3 tacos and $3 margaritas during happy hour.  This was a great find.  We had a few tacos, 2 of which were the happy hour special that day and one extra -- one was salmon & mango which my bf said was amazing, another had cactus in it, and mine was pulled pork if I remember correctly.  Both the food and margs were amazing.  The bartenders were extremely friendly, one even gave us a bunch of recommendations of bars to check out while we were in town.  The only reason it doesnt get 5 stars from me is because it closes so early.  It seems like so many restaurants in this area close by like 9 or 10pm, which is crazy to me because Im used to not even going out to dinner until 830 or 9pm.

Chicken and ribs were very good.  Wife did not like the beans which were watery (but I thought tasty).  We were given plastic fork, knife & spoon which made eating difficult.  (Try slicing meat with a plastic knife.)  Corn was pretty bad.\n\nWe ended up going back there for 2 breakfasts (mid-week BTW) and had no trouble getting in.  My wife was very happy with hers.   I had omelets both times and 1st was good and 2nd was passable.  Good toast (no small thing) and breakfast potatoes.\n\nWe did play slots there quite a bit.  My wife ended up breaking even (including losses at the big casinos) and I didn't lose too much with several hours of play.\n\nEllis is a 1 (Vegas) block walk from Bally's by a less than delightful fenced off, abandoned parking lot.  A couple of street people (junkies?) seem to sit out by the 7-11, but no trouble.  My wife was glad I was with her.\n\nNot really busy while we were there so smoke was not a problem, but it's one thing I hate about casinos.  I wonder why non-smokers have so few (or no) options?

If they quote you an hourly rate, I _highly_ recommend getting them to commit to a maximum time-frame for your project and have them provide a price list for any packing materials to be used.\n\nThe two men I had for the packing were courteous and relatively efficient. I was shocked, however, at what we ended up being charged for boxes and packing material. Especially, when asked, they could not provide us any sort of itemization for what was used. \n\nThe next day for the move, we had one of the same people and a new person who seemed to be about 20 with very little experience moving. Again, they were courteous and very careful in the handling of our furniture. But they were the slowest movers I've ever used. \n\nIt took just short of eight hours for them to move a three-bedroom house. There was a great deal of chatting between the two movers and hanging out in the truck. The \"greener\" of the two movers also frequently hovered around seeming uncertain of what needed to be done next.  I was literally standing over them in the 110 degree heat by the end of it trying to get them to finish. It then took them close to another hour to get hold of the main office and try to figure out the paperwork. \n\nWe had planned to also use this company for my partner's move in two weeks but, based on our experience, we will be using another company.","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":0}

We were unable to finish his so we packed it up and enjoyed the rest later that night. And it was delicious! I should also note that the service at this location was impeccable, my boyfriend forgot to check off which gravy he wanted, he left that box blank, so when they brought us our dishes they also brought a soup bowl full of gravy for him, just in case, without us even asking.

The only thing this dentist did was 'drill' and didn't put the thread around the prepped teeth or temporaries.\nI had a lot of pain with the temporaries but the dentist couldn't be bothered. Instead of figuring out what's happening, they hurried to put the permanent crowns on without asking me if I am satisfied with them. I had TMJ for a month along with other pain but the dentist was ready to send me to the Endodontist when it was a bite issue. I asked him to take an xray to verify the post work but he refused. So I went to see another dentist and found out that these crowns have 'OVERHANGS' and he graded this work as a 'C'. This will lead to tooth decay and bone loss. \nI really wish I hadn't gone to see him.

On saturday and sunday, it even has an awesome BREAKFAST BUFFET with variety of chutneys, south indian delicacies like vada, idli, Upma,Pongal, sheera etc.  The prices are very reasonable, the staff is friendly and overall ambiance is great. The decor allows the simplistic beauty of the food to really shine. It's one place that really reminds me of my native place and the culture of India.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The place was very packed as it's apparently the popular place during spring training. Hubby ordered steak. It seemed like a blackened piece of char but he tried it. He said it was hard to describe, but the absolute worst steak he's ever had. This place needs a new chef or something. The steak doesn't come with a baked potato, but it came with cut up carrots and corn on the cob. The carrots didn't look appetizing and I didn't see anyone who had finished them- what a waste. He ordered the baked potato at a charge but he shared it with me. They give you a huge salad that's drenched in a dressing- Italian maybe. Service was ok- our guy was nice. What I was very irritated by was the staff yelling Excuse Me! every time they needed to get by you. We were a group of 8 trying to make it to a point where we could grab a nice pic of the couple, and so as a group were trying to make our way thru this crowded place. I found it rude the way the girls usually would yell from behind us, Excuse me as they tried to get by. Of course, we moved aside after being yelled at. That is just poor taste from a service stand point. I don't get why this place could be so crowded, except for the view. It's overpriced and low quality. The guy did remove my hubby's steak dinner from the bill so that was good and we appreciated that. We did pay fifteen dollars for the baked potato and my side salad (our table had 18% gratuity added) but I was grateful to not have to pay for his entree.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

But to no avail, because no one ever answered the phone. BTW I was still charged for the food.\n\nSo the next day I called the store at 11AM (an hour after advertised opening time) and again, no one answered. I then called again that same day at 4PM and asked for a manager. The manager told me that \"They are short employees on Monday nights\" and that he saw my order in the morning and was going to void it out for me. \\\n\nNow me also working in the food business, I decided not to give the guy a hard time. \n\nBut today. (3 days later) I checked my account and found that the charge still went thru!\nSo again I called them today at 12AM and again NO ANSWER. I even went as far as to call the pluming store that is right next to Oliveos and they told me that no one was there and that I should waste my time coming down in person to complain.....\n\nSo here I am $20.88 Short, with no fricking pizza and no refund.\n\nHopefully the owner sees this and messages me so I can tell him how to run a business.\n\np.s.

I went in and talked to a woman named Susan. She was very nice and helpful, however when the negotiating started she totally shut down and acted more annoyed than interested in making a sale. Secondly we settled on a price until I noticed that my taxes for a Veloster were almost $4000!!!!! There is no way taxes should be that high!! They then said that the taxes were high because the ADDED the price for my trade-in AFTER they already SUBTRACTED the value of the car. Essentially, making my trade-in $0. After I confronted them about this, they said \"oh yeah thats weird\" and then changed the taxes to $2500, which would be fine...... If they didn't add the $1500 into a section titles \"OTHER FEES\"..... they are liars who try to jip you out of money. \n\n      After all that chaos we were able to settle on another total because of me knowing that they tried to rip me off. At this point i think, \"ok maybe all dealerships do this\" and I didn't respond to the red flags. I went to financing where I was told I could be financed. Signed all my paperwork and left with the title saying %8.99. \n\n     The next day I returned to the dealership to receive the detailing for the car because it was out in the rain. I give Susan the car and she runs into the car and proceeds to go get it cleaned. After 50 minutes or so, she comes running after me saying, \"WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!!!!!! HOW COULD YOU HIT SOMEONE!!\". I was bewildered at this point. She went in the back and ran into another dealership car and then tried to BLAME it on me. Simply pathetic. They got everything buffed out and it was not noticeable so I just wanted to leave. \n\n     After having the car for six days, they call me back one morning and say \"Oh, well, your rate has changed to 17%; pay it or bring the car back. No sympathy at all. These people are scammers, cheaters, and lairs.\n\n     It's been 2 weeks and Mark, in the financial department has YET to give me my down payment money back.

So my mixer arrived before my food. The employee said \"here's your custard\" slammed it on the table and walked away quickly. About two minutes later the rest of my order arrived. I explained to the trainee my custard was supposed to be later. He took it and said \"sorry, we'll throw it away and make a new one when you're ready.\" \n\nOnce I finished my order I went back to the counter with my receipt and asked for my custard. The manager gave me a new number and marked it on the receipt and told it would be right out. I heard her tell them it needed to be made. Sat waiting for 10 minutes before I walked back up to inquire where my order was. The employee behind the counter pawned it off on the employee working the custard area, \"he wants to know where his later custard is. He's been waiting for 10 mins.\" The trainee says \"no one told me.\" He looks at the receipt with the order and asked what kind it is again. Finally get my custard about three minutes later with a \"sorry, sir.\"\n\nOh and they are having a holiday sweepstakes that is not available to folks living in CA. Thanks for making me feel welcome! I don't need to eat here ever again.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I purchased refrigerator, stove, and dishwasher in February...   Saving money was not worth it.  First, the delivery guys come in said the refrigerator will not fit.  Well i did the measurements and it would.  They spoke spanish to each other.  All of the sudden the refrigerator was damaged and the did not let me see it. Delivered another on Sunday.    Second, they got the stove in,  they supposively shut off the gas as my valve is in the basement.  They claimed it could not move the stove all the way back, that i need a gas company to move the line.  This was all done on Friday.   Monday, I go in my kitchen i smelled gas.  Called the gas company to find out HHGREGG did not use the shutoff valve but loosed a bolt.  I watched them, what did i know.   Then i got Mertz to come to move gas line.  $135 later to find out they can move the stove back.   Thirdly, they put my dishwasher in crookedly.  They had to come back.  They unscrewed one side and shoved it in.  Then the disposal kept backing up in my dishwasher. I called they said that was normal.  I said no it is not.  The same guy came, moved one piece said should be good.  Heck no, called again, they made service call again.  The,people never called for time range, i called they said it is scheduled and no time. That i cannot call until after 530 if they do not show. Then called nothing, called the next day. Finally they got someone there.  He said it was hooked up wrong a suppoively fixed it.  Guess what it was not fixed and seriously another repeat, no call for time just got off after an 1.5 hour time, mostly hold and transfers.  No time again.  They to call me and suppoively sending me 100 dollars, better not be a gift card.  Bc they cannot pay me a milloin dollars,to EVER shop at another HHGREGG again!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I have been going to Golden Apple for years.  Usually I wait 10-15 minutes at each appointment, which is bad enough, but this time was the worst.  For this last appointment, I was asked to come in 10-15 minutes early to complete new paperwork due to management or ownership change, I wasn't clear on the reason.  Anyway, I arrived early as requested, completed my paperwork and was shown to the procedure room on time.  I should say that the receptionist was unsmiling and bordering on rude.  In addition, the person who showed me to the room was not knowledgeable and evasive with my two or three questions, telling me to ask the doctor on each of them.  Thirty minutes later, no one had come to inform me of a reason for the delay, or an estimate of how much longer the wait would be.  In fact, I thought I was forgotten.  So I went to the receptionist, who informed me that the doctor was with a new patient and should be finished any minute.  No apology, or even acknowledgment of my inconvenience; in fact, her attitude was almost to the effect of feeling bothered.  After returning to the room and waiting another 5-8 minutes, I left after being at my appointment for more than 50 minutes.  I had rearranged my work day and simply did not have time for the procedure, especially since I had no idea how much longer I'd have to wait.  In my opinion, Dr. Figueroa and the staff at Golden Apple do not respect their patients' time, or at least that of their existing patients.  New patients, beware.  I certainly hope Golden Apple does not have a policy to charge for missed appointments.  That would be a joke considering the disrespect they show their existing patients through the complete lack of regard for their time.  I highly advise trying one of the many other medical spas in the West Valley.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Another great thing is that all the items (At least all the ones I've seen) are MSRP. This is the best football gear store I have ever been to by a mile.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

We had a request for someone to unload our truck in short notice, he was able to accommodate us very quickly and efficiently.  Most professional and very careful.  Would definitely use them again.
